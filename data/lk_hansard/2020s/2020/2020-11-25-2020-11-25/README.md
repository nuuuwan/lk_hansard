A year ago, last November, the people of Sri Lanka - Asias oldest democracy - resoundingly expressed their mandate for a non-aligned, friendly Foreign Policy of Kalyaana Mithra, which is stated in the Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour presented by His Excellency the President, for which he got a resounding mandate from the people. As given by His Excellency the President, the vision of the Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour is to achieve the fourfold outcome of a productive citizenry, a contented family, a disciplined and just society and a prosperous nation. Our commitment to safeguard the mandate of the people and their vision of Sri Lanka as a Unitary State that enjoys sovereignty, independence, security, territorial integrity, human rights, democracy and prosperity remains unwavered. It was on this basis that, as the Foreign Minister representing Sri Lanka, I spoke before the Human Rights Council of the United Nations in Geneva this February and withdrew Sri Lanka from the co-sponsorship of Resolution 30/1, which had cast upon Sri Lanka an obligation to infringe the sovereignty of the people, violate the Constitution and the democratic principles of governance and compel Sri Lanka to turn its backs on the very heroes who delivered us from the 30 years of turmoil and strife.

I would like to read a small section of the Sri Lankan Governments decision taken by His Excellency the President and the Cabinet of Ministers and presented to Parliament. Prior to leaving for Geneva, we followed the procedure of democratic governance unlike on the occassion of co-sponsoring the Resolution, which no one knew. Even the President at that time, His Excellency Maithreepala Sirisena, stated that he was not aware of the final text, of the document. I do not want to go into the details of what happened thereafter, the bickering and fighting that took place between the Prime Ministers Office and the Presidents Office. It is very clear. . , co-sponsored Resolution . Sir, I would like to quote from the speech I delivered at the Human Rights Council in Geneva conveying our Government's decision.

"Notwithstanding withdrawing from co-sponsorship of this resolution, Sri Lanka remains committed to achieving the goals set by the people of Sri Lanka on accountability and human rights, towards sustainable peace and reconciliation. To this end;

a) The Government of Sri Lanka declares its commitment to achieve sustainable peace through an inclusive, domestically designed and executed reconciliation and accountability process, including through the appropriate adaptation of existing mechanisms, in line with the Governments policy framework. This would comprise the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry (COI) headed by a Justice of the Supreme Court, to review the reports of previous Sri Lankan COIs which investigated alleged violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law (IHL), to assess the status of implementation of their recommendations and to propose deliverable measures to implement them, keeping in line with the new Governments policy.

So, the UN Human Rights Council very clearly knows our stand, our position and what we are doing, and we are in the process of setting up that Commission. I further stated in my speech, I quote:

"b) The Government will also address other outstanding concerns and introduce institutional reforms where necessary, in a manner consistent with Sri Lankas commitments, including to the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda (SDGs). We will implement policies rooted in the Governments commitment to the people by advancing individual and collective rights and protections under the law, ensuring justice and reconciliation and addressing the concerns of vulnerable sections of society. Special attention will be paid to environmental protection in the formulation and implementation of government policies. The President, in his policy statement at the inauguration of the Fourth Session of the 8th Parliament of Sri Lanka, reiterated his vision to make Sri Lanka one of the worlds leading nations in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. A discussion has already been held between the President and the UN Resident Coordinator where it has been agreed to connect the relevant UN agencies to assist the Government of Sri Lanka in the implementation of the SDGs

c) Sri Lanka will continue to remain engaged with, and seek, as required, the assistance of the UN and its agencies, including the regular human rights mandates/bodies and mechanisms, in capacity building and technical assistance, in keeping with domestic priorities and policies.

d) In conjunction with all members of the UN, Sri Lanka will seek to work towards the closure of the Resolution.

. , . This is what I finally said at the Human Rights Council in Geneva: "We call upon all stakeholders, within and outside this august body, to co-operate with Sri Lanka in this endeavour."

, -19 . , . -19 . . , , , , ... . She had been appointed as the Governor of the Northern Province. The President had full confidence in Mrs. Charles to appoint her as the Governor. , . . . , . Human Rights Council , I quoted Rt. Hon. Lord Nasebys statement on the confidential papers of the British

409 410

Government which are available today, where all these numbers had been refuted by him with factual evidence by British authorities, and some keep on trying to say that our forces have committed crimes with these unprecedented, unsubstantitated figures being floated against our country. We have rejected that.

, this is a book by Lord Naseby, who has come up with all the papers, titled "Sri Lanka: Paradise lost; Paradise Regained". . . , . . . , . . Under the right to information, Lord Naseby has gone into these details. What the British information channels had transferred to London through the Home Office is now available.

. , a country-specific Resolution has never been brought before Geneva. , to reject the country-specific Resolution that had been moved. . . .

Sri Lanka shall continue to work and cooperate with the United Nations, but only through the avenues empowered by the mandate given to this just, fair and democratically elected Government so that it may uphold its fidelity to the peoples desire to see a sovereign Sri Lanka which enshrines democratic values and human rights. Sri Lanka's commitment, we keep with the mandate of the people of a sovereign and secure Sri Lanka, is instrumental in our commitment to the world as a Kalyaana Mithra Foreign Policy.

It is through our non-aligned and friendly Foreign Policy of Kalyaana Mithra that we have pursued the fight against terrorism with the cooperation of the nations across the world, big nations as well as smaller nations who have supported Sri Lanka. We are grateful to so many countries for their continued proscription of the LTTE, whose commitment to violence has not wavered since the end of the war. Even last week, India renewed its proscription of the LTTE.

Through His Excellency the President's "Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour", Sri Lanka has been strengthening friendships with nations across the world. Beginning in November last year, His Excellency

President Gotabaya Rajapaksas first-ever, high-level visit abroad was to India, closely followed by the visits of the Hon. Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. Such is the reflection of our drive to continue our close relationship with our neighbours and members of IORA, BIMSTEC and SAARC. As the Foreign Minister, I led the Sri Lankan Delegation to the Annual Informal Meeting of the SAARC Council of Ministers on the 24th of September, 2020.

Our relations with key partners have deepened.

This year, we have witnessed a series of high-level visits ranging from His Excellency Sergey Lavrov, Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation, the Foreign Minister of India and the Foreign Minister of China who visited Sri Lanka. The Foreign Ministers of Japan, Pakistan, the Maldives and Luxembourg also visited Sri Lanka and finally, the Secretary of State of the United States visited us four weeks ago. Further to that dialogue with the nations from all around the world, there has been an uptick in discussions with officials up and down the spectrum such as the Hon. Dominic Raab and Lord Tariq Ahmad of the United Kingdom via virtual and telesonic communication and with many other countries. So, the Embassies are not closed, as stated; Embassies are functioning and we are using available new channels of communication. Even in the Middle East, our Embassies are not closed; our Embassies are functioning. Our relations with such nations, including the United Kingdom, have been positive, irrespective of the issues that arise out of the freedoms protected by our democracies. I am glad that Sri Lanka and all its many friendly nations abroad are deeply committed to ending the wanton violence endemic to terrorism in search of lasting peace to all our countries which continue to proscribe the LTTE.

This year, I spoke at the 20th UN Commemoration of Vesak, the most sacred day in the Buddhist calendar, which the UN General Assembly unanimously declared by Resolution as an Observance Day through the efforts of the late. Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, the then Foreign Minister.

Further to that, we continue to interact and hold special discussions with Ambassadors and Hon. Consuls of all nations stationed in Colombo, constantly pushing through fora conducted digitally et cetera. Two new Embassies that we plan to establish this year will be in Spain and Romania. Sri Lanka - the Foreign Policy of Kalyaana Mithra is deeply rooted in our history - is one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement, the 65th Anniversary of which we commemorated last month and has continued to play a significant role in multilateral deliberations at the UN, particularly representing the interests of the Global South. The Bandung Conference and successive developments united our countries to end colonialism, opposing foreign intervention, aggression, foreign occupation, domination and to respect sovereignty and territorial integrity while recognizing the equality of all nations, both large and small.

Hon. Chairman, our commitment to our fellow Non-Aligned Nations remains strong and so too is our commitment to the sovereignty of our friends through our call to end the economic blockade on Cuba, on which your Government did not have a policy. You all were wavering, avoiding when the vote came up. We have also restored our position in relation to Iran, Venezuela and others. In line with Sri Lankas continual advocacy for the Global South, we have continually raised the issue of impending and irreversible damages due to Global Climate Change and its impact on the ecosystems.

Regarding the Palestine cause, we have continually raised the issue and continue our obligation and commitment to the Palestinian people. I do not want to recall how the last Government behaved. ? Having chaired the 13th Meeting of Parties to the Montreal Protocol, which saw the signing of the Colombo Declaration, I shall highlight later at the 03rd Ministerial Meeting of the Archipelagic and Island States Forum what His Excellency the President raised as a priority in the National Development Policy Plan during his Inaugural Speech and at my virtual address at the 44th Annual Meeting of Ministers of the G77. It is imperative that we concertedly seek to address the issue of climate change and FinTec green economy to mobilize our collective efforts to secure environmental protection.

His Excellency the President, the Hon. Prime Minister and I stated, during the 75th Anniversary of the UN that the President's Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour reaffirms our commitment to achieving all the 18 SDGs by 2030, which is reflected in the appointment of a working group to study the current status of Sri Lanka's implementation and progress towards achieving the SDGs.

The issues of environmental protection and poverty are inextricably interlinked. Though we have made great strides in our fight against poverty, this Government remains dedicated to its eradication in all its forms. Sri Lankas Presidential Task Force in Charge of Economic Revival and Poverty Eradication operates with the objective of creating a production economy promoting local industries. The Government has granted financial relief to over six million families and vulnerable groups and established a COVID-19 Healthcare and Social Security Fund. As the world progresses towards a sustainable, therapeutic solution to COVID-19, Sri Lanka has tirelessly canvassed that all countries have unrestricted access to vital medical resources required to respond to this virus and that political motives do not impede such access, which would undermine the worlds collective commitment to the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The Sri Lankan Government would once again like to thank all the countries who have been helping us in our attempt to manage the COVID-19 challenges. Also, I would like to mention about the UK/Sri Lanka, Oxford University COVID vaccine collaboration.

In this context, I recall His Excellency President Gotabaya Rajapaksas call to the international community at the Financing for Development Conference for debt relief and to adopt fiscal policies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. My good Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, asked, "What are we doing about our debt?" His Excellency the President was one of the initial leaders of nations to raise the issue of debt relief, not only for Sri Lanka, but for most of the other countries too.

As the world reels from this global COVID -19 pandemic awaiting a vaccine, we work to carry out His Excellency the Presidents coordinated efforts to fight the pandemic and to address the immediate concerns of stranded Sri Lankans by organizing and facilitating their repatriation via Government organized repatriation flights and charter flights with the collaboration of the 67 overseas Missions and Posts and the Presidential Task Force as the repatriation of Sri Lankan students, initially from Wuhan, China had been carried out. By the end of last week, the Government of Sri Lanka has repatriated 46,250 Sri Lankans from 126 countries and territories. To assist such operations, the Foreign Ministry has launched an online portal to assist the Sri Lankan community overseas, through which 64,107 have now registered.

Yet the Foreign Ministry has further ambitions, as the Hon. Prime Minister stated last week, to stride towards coordination with overseas Sri Lankans through the creation of a special office dedicated to the international Sri Lankan community. Such an office will be able to capitalize and further enhance the economic breakthroughs made during the last year such as access secured to the lucrative Latin American market. The largest country in Latin America, Brazil, has relaxed their restrictions on Sri Lankan cinnamon exports. I say Brazil, for that is the latest we have achieved. For Sri Lankan communities, new outreach such as the skilled labour personnel in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and South East Asia was previously not present.

, , .

One such breakthrough that I am happy to announce is the National Ocean Affairs Committees submission by the professionals of the relevant subject under the Law of the Sea Convention to the UN for an extended seabed area with high potential for petroleum and other marine resources, which has reached an advanced stage. Nine rounds of negotiations have been successfully completed and the last meeting with the UN Sub-Commission was held in February, 2020. Hopefully, negotiations could be concluded with two more meetings. This boon and the equitable allocation of resources stemming from this breakthrough shall flow to all of Sri Lankan people and make us richer, opening a new door in our development in the petroleum sector.

, I came to Parliament before the Dissolution for the withdrawal of the Counter Terrorism Bill. It was brought before the last Parliament forcibly by

413 414

the last Government as one of the draconian legislations. Luckily, all of us went before the Committee chaired by the Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake, who accepted most of the submissions made and that that would be a draconian law. Even the Hon. Speaker, I think, participated in one or two sessions of that Committee. We have withdrawn that Bill, but we are considering amending some Sections of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and we have started discussions on the subject.

. . . , .

Before I conclude my speech, I would like to thank the Hon. State Minister Tharaka Balasuriya, who would speak in the evening, the Foreign Secretary, Prof. Colombage, our Foreign Ministry Officials, Ambassadors, Hon. Consul Generals and the Diplomats of all nations and organizations in Sri Lanka for their tireless contribution to upholding the peoples desire to see a Sri Lanka in concordant and having a prosperous friendship with all nations.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Thank you. The next speaker is, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran.

Before he starts, the Hon. Isuru Dondangoda will take the Chair.

, .

, , .

Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. ISURU DODANGODA took the Chair.

[11.42 a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Presiding Member, I am happy to follow the Hon. Minister himself as we discuss the Votes of the Ministry of Foreign. The Minister is an experienced Parliamentarian and an able person and I am glad to discuss a few matters with regard to Sri Lankas Foreign Policy while he is present together with a very able and dynamic young Parliamentarian, the Minister of State for Regional Co-operation, Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya.

It was rather comical to witness the spectacle this morning as we started the Discussion, the bickering between the Government Benches and the main Opposition, each trying to absolve themselves from responsibilities they had undertaken in the international arena.

The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella was blaming President Mahinda Rajapaksa for agreeing with the Secretary-General of the UN on the 26th of May, 2009 in Kandy, undertaking to inquire into the allegations of human rights violations. And for his part, the Hon. Minister was blaming the main Opposition for co-sponsoring, when they were in Office, Resolution HRC 30/1 before the UN Human Rights Commission. These acts are not acts of certain governments that are in office at a particular point in time. These undertakings are given on behalf of the State and in the international system these obligations are taken very seriously. The Minister read out the letter sent in February this year claiming to withdraw from the co-sponsorship of HRC Resolution 30/1. All of us know that you cannot withdraw from an act that is already done. The Minister was hurt to say in this House that that co-sponsorship happened without the knowledge of anyone, not even the President at that time. I want to ask a question. If that be so, how did Sri Lanka co-sponsor Resolutions 34/1 and 40/1 several months thereafter, both of which were merely rollover Resolutions of 30/1? Resolution 30/1 was done on the 1st of October, 2015; Resolution 34/1 was in March, 2017 and Resolution 40/1 was in March, 2019 - three times over, the same contents. How does a responsible Minister stand up here and say that nobody knew about the contents? These undertakings are on behalf of Sri Lanka - of the State. There are serious repercussions if you resile from international commitments.

Sir, I want to pose another question. On the 29th of July, 1987 Sri Lanka entered into an international bilateral agreement with India commonly known as the Indo-Lanka Accord. Various speakers in this House, at various times, say various things about this Accord. Mr. Foreign Minister, would you have the courage to write a letter to India like you did to the UN Human Rights Council and withdraw from the Indo-Lanka Accord? If you do not and you have not done that over several decades of your party in office, you must honour it. You must honour it. There is no point in saying, "This was thrust down our throat". If it was thrust down your throat, withdraw from it. Write a letter to India like you did to the UN Human Rights Council. Are you brave enough to do that?

I will read out the fundamental principles of the Indo-Lanka Accord, which is still binding on Sri Lanka. It is an international bilateral agreement.

One, Sri Lanka is a multiethnic and a multilingual society. Two, each ethnic group has a distinct cultural and linguistic identity which has to be carefully nurtured. Three, the Northern and the Eastern Provinces have been areas of historical habitation of Sri Lankan Tamil-speaking peoples. Those are the basic principles laid down at the forefront of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord.

So, you cannot resile from that nor can you even resile from undertakings given to the UN Human Rights Council, not once but three times. But, more importantly, before President Rajapaksa did that in May, 2009, on the 2nd of March, 2009, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, on behalf of Sri Lanka, said this at the UN Human Rights Council. He said, Our national discourse has been dominated for decades by an ethnic issue which requires a political solution as a means to resolve the problem". He did not say "a military solution"; he said it requires a "political solution". "On a recommendation of the All-Party Representative Committee, we are able to properly implement the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution which was passed in 1987". Those were words of a Minister of your Government at that time.

Following that, on the 26th of May, this is what President Mahinda Rajapaksa said in a joint communiqu with the UN Secretary-General: "President Rajapaksa expressed his firm resolve to proceed with the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment as well as to begin a broader dialogue with all parties, including the Tamil parties in the new circumstances to further enhance this process and to bring about lasting peace and development in Sri Lanka". Why did he do that? Will you now write a letter to the UN Secretary-General withdrawing from this commitment that your President made on the 26th of May, 2009? He said, "Not only the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment". Eleven years have passed and that has not been implemented. Your leaders solemn promise to the Secretary-General of the UN, no less! I am saying this because there are repercussions if you do not deliver on your promises to the international community. You pride yourself that we are a part of the civilized community of nations. We will not be part of a civilized community of nations if we willy-nilly ignore and violate commitments that we make to the international community. I am only referring to his guarantee of implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment and going beyond that. But, there are other agreements in that with regard to violation of human rights and that there will be a domestic mechanism. In your letter in February this year too, you say that there will be a domestic mechanism. Where is it? Several months have passed, but where is that plan? For 11 years, you fooled the world and now, for 11 months also, you have fooled the world or you think that you can fool all the people all the time. That is what you think. Then, on the very next day after President Mahinda Rajapaksa agreed with that, on the 27th of May, 2009, at the UN Human Rights Council a Resolution was adopted which stated, Welcoming also the recent assurance given by the President of Sri Lanka.... - the previous day, he gave that assurance - ".....that he does not regard a military solution as a final solution as well as his commitment to a political solution with the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to bring about lasting peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka,". So, the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment was the first step that was promised over and over and over again, not just to the UN Human Rights Council, but also to India.

Then, I am going to read the three joint communiqus that were issued, once with the Prime Minister, Dr.

Manmohan Singh where President Mahinda Rajapaksas commitment was recorded.

It stated, "The Prime Minister emphasized that a meaningful devolution package...." - this was in June, 2010 and ten years have passed - "....building upon the Thirteenth Amendment..." - that is what President Mahinda Rajapaksa said - "... would create the necessary conditions for a lasting political settlement". Ah, there comes the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe who gave the assurance to the UN on the 2nd of March, 2009. That communiqu went on to say, "The President of Sri Lanka reiterated its determination to evolve a political settlement acceptable to all communities that would act as a catalyst to create necessary conditions in which all the people of Sri Lanka could lead their lives in an atmosphere of peace, justice and dignity consistent with democracy, pluralism, equal opportunity and respect for human rights. Towards this end, the President expressed his resolve to continue to implement in particular the relevant provisions of the constitution designed to strengthen national amity and reconciliation through empowerment. In this context, he shared his ideas on conducting a broader dialogue with all parties involved". The Prime Minister of India expressed Indias constructive support for efforts that build peace and reconciliation among all communities in Sri Lanka.

The then External Affairs Minister the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris visited New Delhi in May, 2011. I am glad that the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris is in the House when I quote from the joint press statement issued after that. "The External Affairs Minister of Sri Lanka affirmed his Governments commitment to ensuring expeditious and concrete progress in the ongoing dialogue between the Government of Sri Lanka and representatives of Tamil parties. A devolution package building upon the Thirteenth Amendment ...." - those are words of assurance given by the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris to India - "....would contribute towards creating the necessary conditions for such reconciliation".

That was again reiterated in January, 2012 when the External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna visited Sri Lanka. With the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris by his side, Mr. S.M. Krishna said, "The Government of Sri Lanka has, on many occasions, conveyed to us its commitment to move towards a political settlement based on full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment of Sri Lankan Constitution and building on it so as to achieve meaningful devolution of powers. We look forward to an expeditious and constructive approach to the dialogue process".

Now, a decade has passed. You have not done a thing. Some effort was taken by the last Government. We participated in good faith; the Hon. Members who are now in the Government also participated. The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs was a Member of the Steering Committee. The Hon. Susil Premajayantha even headed an ad hoc committee with regard to relations between the Parliament and Provincial Councils and gave a good report. The Hon. Bandula Gunawardena chaired another committee. The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe

417 418

chaired another committee on human rights or fundamental rights and gave a brilliant report. The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe who hides behind his lamp all the time here in this House, in these sessions, was also a Member of the Steering Committee and drafted the proposals with regard to land powers. So, there was an effort. But, you have abandoned that now and you talk of repealing - [Interruption.] Yes, Hon. State Minister Tharaka Balasuriya? - [Interruption.] Thank you for that assurance, that you all will abide by all the assurances given to the world.

Sir, before I conclude, I need to touch on one or two other matters. I am thankful to the Hon. Minister for giving the number of Sri Lankans who have been repatriated. But, there is a serious issue with regard to our labour force in the Middle East, who contribute so much to our economy, not being given priority in the repatriation process.

So, I hope the Hon. Foreign Minister will look into that and give them priority.

Secondly, this is the month of November - I said this some time ago also - in which all those who died in wars are remembered. That is why we sell poppy the world over. This is the period in which that happens. And in Sri Lanka, particularly in the Tamil areas, for the last three decades, it has become a custom to remember the dead who fought the war. They may have fought the State, but nevertheless, they are dead and their families and others have a right to remember them as they are accustomed to do. The Government has taken great exemption to this suddenly this year and is flying members of the Attorney-Generals Department by special helicopters to Jaffna, Mullaitivu and all over the place amid COVID-19 restrictions when the Attorney-Generals Department is an isolated zone - they are flying around all over without being quarantined - to oppose and to obtain orders from Magistrates preventing mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers from remembering the dead, which is most unfortunate and a most undignified act by the State.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up. Please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I will take five minutes from the Hon. Selvam Adaikkalanathans time.

Honouring and remembering the dead, even in our culture is a solemn affair. The other day, I stood with a mother who is 83 years old. She has only a shack for a house. Her son died in 1985. She lit her lamp and I participated in that event. It is a solemn occasion. Why are you so worried? Why are you so scared of the dead? Is it because you put them to death in the most brutal manner violating all the international norms?

The other thing is, sovereignty is for all the people; sovereignty is not to be enjoyed by the majority only. That must be kept in mind. If the majority only enjoys sovereignty, then you are leaving the other peoples out, you are forcing them to claim their own sovereignty and that would be your own act.

When the Foreign Minister started his speech, he said he wants to give a lesson to the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella about the fact that India is a Union because there were princely States and they all had to be brought together. I want to ask him about the history of this Island. When the Europeans conquered this Island, was there one State here, was there one kingdom in this Island? No, there was not one kingdom in this Island. There were three kingdoms in this Island and they all fell to western powers at different times. It was only in 1833 consequent to the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission Report, for administrative convenience, it was made one country.

So, when you try to take lessons on how India became a Union or how the United States of America became States coming together, you must remember the history of this country as well. This country consists of different peoples who each have their own rights under international law. Violation of international law is not a domestic matter. You cannot hide behind the cloak of State sovereignty. There is nothing called State sovereignty today. Sovereignty is to be enjoyed by the people. You cannot hide behind the concept of State sovereignty, violate international law and claim that this is a domestic matter. No, it is not. You know that very well. So, in fashioning the countrys foreign policy you have now gone on reverse gear, you have put the country at peril.

On this particular occasion when we debate the Votes of the Foreign Ministry, I think it is our duty to bring it to your notice that you need to turn around, and promoting accountability and reconciliation is not a matter that violates the sovereignty of any country. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris. You have 13 minutes.

[12.04 p.m.] () .. ( ) ( () .. - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of Education) Hon. Presiding Member, it is a pleasure to follow the contribution by the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran.

As we discuss the Foreign Policy of our country in this august Assembly, the circumstances in the world at large are certainly not propitious. COVID-19 has proved to be a dire calamity. There are many lessons to be learnt from this situation. One of the most important lessons is that no nation, no group of countries, no culture has the

419 420

monopoly of wisdom; nobody can claim to know all the right answers. The contemporary experience of the world demonstrates convincingly that there is no room whatsoever for arrogance, bigotry and self-righteousness. Today, more than at any other time in our history, if we survive this crisis at all, it can only happen on the basis of humility, the spontaneous sharing of experiences and a readiness to work hand in hand in a spirit of comradeship and solidarity.

The cornerstones of the Foreign Policy of our country are crystal clear. They were set out with exemplary clarity by His Excellency the President Gotabaya Rajapaksa at his inauguration in the hallowed precincts of the Ruwanweliseya Temple in Anuradhapura. We seek friendship with all nations. We go out of our way to refrain from interfering in the domestic affairs of other nations. At the same time, reciprocally, we entertain the expectation that others will respect, without question, the right of the Parliament and the people of Sri Lanka to determine our own destiny. This is the rationale underpinning the Statement made by the Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, at the Human Rights Council in Geneva barely three months after the assumption of office by His Excellency Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The Government which the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena represents unequivocally rejected the Resolutions of the Human Rights Council - 30/1, 34/1 and 40/1 - respectively of 2015, 2017 and 2019. These Resolutions were not only supported, but indeed co-sponsored by the Yahapalana Government of that time.

This is scarcely believable when one considers the content and the impact of those Resolutions. Indisputably, those Resolutions dealt with matters which were within the purview of the national institutions in Sri Lanka. They required the rearrangement of Sri Lankas Constitutional provisions, the restructuring of our armed forces and the police and the repeal of major legislations such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Those Resolutions also empowered foreign and Commonwealth Judges to adjudicate on grave allegations relating to war crimes which were levelled against the armed forces of Sri Lanka. That is the effect of operative Paragraph 6 of the Resolution of 2015. This was in blatant violation of the supreme law of this country, the Constitution.

The abdication of self-respect was further compounded by the acceptance by that Government of the obligation to report from time to time to the Human Rights Council and to abide by the judgement of that Council in respect of the adequacy of the progress that had been made in respect of the implementation of these Resolutions.

Sir, the entire edifice of the UN system is based upon one sacred principle and that is a principle relating to the sovereign equality of nations. That principle is illustrated amply by the seminal instruments of the United Nations system such as the Charter, the Declaration of Human Rights and the Jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice and its predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice. All countries that are members of the international community, be they large or small,

affluent or not so affluent, are equal in the eyes of the United Nations system, Sir, equal in intrinsic worth and in inherent value. There can be no discrimination whatsoever. That is why there can be no scope whatsoever for talking down, for hectoring and for patronizing attitudes. This is not to be misunderstood. Counsel from friends, sharing of experiences and suggestions that are made in a spirit of goodwill and friendship are always welcome. They are healthy. But what is absolutely ruled out are judgemental postures in respect of the internal decision-making process of countries dealing with matters which are within their purview.

Now, I have dealt, Sir, with the concept of equality. Equality is basic to the entire United Nations system. But, there is another principle that is equally important and that is the principle of fairness. This is an instinct that is embedded in human nature and it represents a component of all systems of law and justice and indeed, of all civilizations since time immemorial. One must look at both sides of an issue. Evidence has to be weighed in the balance and conclusions must be arrived at objectively without bias or prejudgment.

From that standpoint, very sadly, the people of Sri Lanka have good reason to entertain grave misgivings. Evidence of the highest value has been deliberately disregarded, if that evidence is favourable to the armed forces of Sri Lanka. A clear example of that consists of military dispatches by trusted members of foreign countries reporting confidentially to their own capitals. These have been totally ignored. These dispatches were ferreted out with the greatest difficulty, as the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena pointed out, by personages of the eminence of Lord Michael Naseby both within the House of Lords and outside. There were also very critical findings by Queens Counsels of the eminence of Sir Desmond de Silva, Sir Geoffrey Nice and Rodney Dixon. These findings completely exonerated the armed forces of Sri Lanka from any form of culpability or guilt with regard to war crimes under principles of International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law. So, this document, this body of evidence was there. It was never taken into account; it was deliberately ignored. This was done in the lofty name of human rights. But, it constituted a cynical violation of natural justice and the rules of fairness, both in its substantive and its procedural dimensions.

I do not wish to take much time, Sir. Sri Lanka, we want to insist, is a country with a proud history and a cherished heritage.

Reconciliation, ethnic harmony and transitional justice are not concepts by any means alien to us. We have been nurtured throughout the ages by a rich and vibrant cultural tradition in each of these areas. But, I want to stress that the mechanisms we evolve, if we are to aspire to any measure of success, must necessarily derive from the aspirations of our people. This is because of the importance of context with regard to these matters. The Government of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa fortified by an unrivalled mandate obtained from the people of this country at both

421 422

the Presidential and the Parliamentary Elections has an unflinching resolve to address these issues in earnest. The Government has both the moral and the legal right to the space to do so. We ask for empathy and understanding as we move forward in partnership with the international community to assure to our people a stable and prosperous future.

I thank you, Mr. Presiding Member. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Then, the Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya. You have 13 minutes.

[12.15. p.m.] () ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Thank you for the time, Hon. Presiding Member.

I must apologize to the House if I am breaking the rhythm of what has been a facinating Discussion so far by shifting your attention from the Foreign Ministry to the Ministry of Mass Media.

Mass Media plays a critical role in the social and political lives of people. The quality of media in each society, the degree of independence and freedom are often taken as indicators of the quality of democracy in those societies. We generally regard media as having two functions, firstly, as a watchdog providing politically relevant information to citizens, supporting their ability to make informed political decisions and secondly, serving as a public forum representing the diversity of views in that society. Traditionally, media consisted of print, radio and television, but today, we see the Internet and the digital media platforms becoming far more influential, both as a watchdog and as a public forum more than any other types of media.

Sir, the emergence of digital media arguably has meant that the institution of media has become far more democratic. Today, every citizen has the potential to be a journalist. All of us are able to create news, share news, comment on news and to engage in discussions which can reach a large audience very quickly. Public figures, those in power, are under much more scrutiny than before. This is great from one perspective. It has enabled the multiplicity of voices and perspectives to emerge, which is always a good thing. It has created a much larger critical space regarding public accountability. At the same time, we have to ask ourselves, what does it mean to be truthful, objective, independent and ethical in this context? More importantly, how do we assess what is truthful, objective and ethical in this context and what is the validity of these multiplicity of voices, opinions and perspectives that are offered to us today? These are issues that societies around the world are grappling with. That the tension of ensuring freedom of expression, right to information and protecting citizens from misinformation have become all the more challenging when media

organizations including social media platforms operate on the principle of profit is no secret. In recent times, globally as well as here in Sri Lanka, we have had many examples of the extent to which digital platforms, particularly social media, can be manipulated to serve particular interests, mobilize hate and violence very quickly.

Yet, media regulation is a highly controversial issue since it is tied up so closely with the freedom of expression and the right to information. Government efforts at regulation are viewed with particular suspicion. Sri Lankan governments usually do not have a good reputation in dealing with media. In fact, Sri Lanka, at various points during the last several decades, was considered extremely dangerous for those working in this field.

The list of media personnel who have disappeared, been killed, threatened, intimidated and forced to leave the country is far too long and serves as a severe indictment on successive Governments. Most of these cases remain unresolved and often forgotten. The officers investigating certain well-known cases such as that of Lasantha Wickramatunga and Prageeth Ekneligoda themselves are now being hunted. As a result, these cases are stuck now with no progress or resolution in sight. Such a situation hardly inspires confidence in the Governments intentions with regard to protecting a free and independent media.

Unfortunately, Governments have regarded media either as their enemy or their propaganda machine which can be manipulated at their will. We also have to deal with a situation where our traditional media, whether State-owned or privately-owned, are known to promote particular political agendas. Most media institutions in Sri Lanka are owned by individuals or families closely linked to mainstream political parties. Governments in power usually consider State-owned media as their propaganda machine. Since private media is also closely aligned with mainstream political parties, governments also then control private media. As a result, Sri Lanka has a very few truly independent, traditional media organizations, either print, radio or television. It is in this context that the digital media platforms, however controversial they are, despite all the concerns that I have mentioned previously, have become an important space for hosting alternative and critical perspectives.

Hon. Presiding Member, it is in this context that we need to seriously consider this proposal reported in the Parliament Website that the Hon. Minister of Mass Media has stated at the meeting of the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Mass Media held on the 21st of November that a website regulatory mechanism will be implemented within the next two weeks.

() ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Hon. Minister, may I finish, if you do not mind? Then, you can respond later.

Can such an important and crucial regulatory mechanism be implemented or established within two weeks? The Members present at that Committee - some of whom are in the Chamber today - had also made references to legislation recently passed in Singapore as an example of what could be followed in Sri Lanka. Now, it has become quite common, as you know, for Singapore to be held up as the "model" for Sri Lanka for all things that we need to do. When we do so, when we hold up Singapore as the model, we tend to overlook the fact that it is an extremely tightly controlled society where the idea of dissent and protest so essential for democracy is not tolerated. Just recently, it was reported that a Singaporean man was arrested for unlawful assembly for holding a placard with a smiley face in front of a police station. Internet freedom is limited in Singapore and the Government has high powers of censorship, which it uses to stifle criticism and opposition views. Is this what we aspire to? I do not think so. Sri Lankan citizens are highly politically literate and any regulatory mechanism that attempts to stifle the freedom to debate and engage with political ideas would be highly detrimental to our democratic space. While there is a legitimate concern of how digital media platforms can distort information, propagate hate speech et cetera far more dangerously than traditional media, this move by the Government to introduce regulatory mechanisms is of deep concern because the actions of this Government and the Governments historically in Sri Lanka suggest that their intentions are not to regulate, but rather to stifle dissent and the views of its critics while giving a free licence to their own supporters to attack their political opponents. For example, many of us have been victims of fake posts on social media platforms. Several of us have filed complaints with the CID regarding this, but none have been investigated satisfactorily. Yet, social media commentators like Ramzy Razeek, who was arrested under the ICCPR and Computer Crimes Act and is currently on bail, was arrested after he made a complaint of threats he received on something he had said in social media.

During the first cycle of COVID- 19, the police warned media outlets against spreading false or malicious information. This included any criticism of government officials.

The legal basis for this kind of stand is yet to be known.

Dharisha Bastians, former Editor of the "Sunday Observer", faced much harassment over her alleged connection with the abduction of a member of the staff of the Swiss Embassy. Very recently, an individual was questioned by the CID for sharing an image on Facebook. Journalists reporting on environmental issues have been threatened and two journalists were assaulted recently in Mullaitivu when reporting on deforestation. Media

persons have reported that they are asked for unnecessary information when the Government issues press passes and that the Government has hinted at imposing restrictions when issuing passes. The insinuation here is that being critical of Government policy is an act of betrayal. Overall, journalists have reported an increase in self-censorship because of an environment of fear and intimidation.

Sir, what is particularly of concern here is that the Government is adopting double standards when it comes to media regulation, especially in investigations of fake news. Criticism of the Government is interpreted as fake news, distortion and malicious and prompt action is taken, whereas pro-Government media is allowed to say or do whatever it wants about the Opposition or critics of the Government. Thus, there are legitimate fears when the Government says it wants to regulate media, since our experience is that under the guise of regulations, what the Government is seeking to do is to actually suppress dissent and critique. We cannot ignore the fact that there are many occupying extremely powerful positions in this Government, who are allegedly associated with the disappearance, intimidation and even deaths of media persons. At no point has this Government shown that it is tolerant of criticism and dissent, but rather the reaction to criticism has been highly defensive and aggressive. The ethos is one of intolerances and that is hardly conducive to freedom of expression. The intension of the Government, therefore, to establish within two weeks a regulatory mechanism for websites is truly worrying. If such a move is envisaged, then at the very least, the Government needs to engage in a consultative proses to obtain the views of all concerned.

Also, if the intention of the Government is to promote responsible and ethical media practice, then it needs to start with enabling the independence of media organizations. Even if it cannot do so for privately-owned media organizations - the Government can always claim that those are run on the principles of the market - it can certainly start by guaranteeing independent standards in the State-owned media.

There is also the State Ministry for Postal Services and Professional Development of Journalists which comes under the Ministry of Mass Media. Since it is under that State Ministry, it is not very clear how much is allocated from the Budget for professional development of journalists or what plans there are to strengthen professionalism among journalists. Yet, clearly, this is an extremely important area and there is much the Government can do if it is serious about improving the quality of journalism. There are many young people interested in journalism and media, but they do not see this as a career path due to various reasons, not the least being the lack of career prospects and security in this sector. Combining that with the culture of fear and intimidation that Sri Lankan journalists have to contend with, how many would consider this as a viable career option?

Sir, in conclusion, I would like to say that in an increasingly complex media space, there is no doubt that

425 426

a robust dialogue on media ethics and professionalism is urgently required. But, what we are seeing today is not a genuine desire to improve the quality of media or to deal with the very real issues emerging as a result of the transformations in media platforms at the media space. Rather, what we are seeing are attempts to curtail the freedom of expression, protection of pro-Government media organizations and persons and an atmosphere of intimidation and harassment of critical voices. This is surprising for a Government that keeps talking about its popular mandate because what it is actually reflecting is a deep sense of insecurity about its popularity and legitimacy.

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Hon. Presiding Member, looking at and listening to the Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya's contribution, I think it is very unfortunate that her Party Leader has not included her in the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Mass Media. In fact, all these moves were discussed at the Consultative Committee. Particularly, it is not a move by me and that was discussed at length; it took one and a half hours and I think it was one of the longest sessions we had. At that, one of the Members of the Committee suggested that there should be some kind of monitoring of social media. When I was the Minister then, we had numerous discussions as to how you deal with this situation. Firstly, as a primary move, we discussed that all social media institutions should be registered under the Ministry of Mass Media. That is exactly what we discussed. It has been misinformed completely that we are going to have a monitoring body with regard to Facebook and so on. But, it was just a registration, to which all the Members agreed at that time, they said to safeguard their dignity and we only had a debate over the fees. We proposed Rs. 100,000 as the registration fee and Rs. 25,000 as the annual fee, where they requested to make the registration fee Rs. 25,000 and the annual fee Rs. 5,000, to which we readily agreed even in 2014. Unfortunately, during last five years, nothing happed. Therefore, we took it up at the first Consultative Committee Meeting and there were so many things that came out of it at the Consultative Committee. So, that is exactly what was discussed. I am sure the Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Amarasuriya was completely misled and it is a question of misinformation. I think some Members of her Party also participated in the Consultative Committee. I am extremely sorry that her Party Leader has not included such an eloquent and informed lady, who has been a Member of this House, in the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Mass Media.

Hon. Presiding Member, I wish to make some observations on the Ministry of Foreign. It seems that the Government is confused about its Foreign Policy. It does not look like its sound-bite diplomacy is working. At times, they call it neutral and at others, they call it non-aligned. Then, sometimes, they call it India first and at other times, Sri Lanka first" with a focus on Asia. This morning, the affable Minister said that now it is called Kalyana Mithra Policy. Does the Government know that each of these phrases mean something? Does it know that the world is listening to what is being said? Does it know that diplomacy and Foreign Policy is not just about words, but words being followed through with actions?

To start off, the Government has an Admiral" as the Secretary to the Foreign Ministry. I wonder if it is appropriate to use this tag while he holds the position of Chief Accounting Officer of this civilian institution. But, today I noticed that the Hon. Minister did not refer to him as Admiral the only time he mentioned him at the closing of his speech. Is it because some want to openly indicate that the countrys Foreign Policy is in the hands of the military now while the Hon. Minister wants none of it?

Sir, words matter in diplomacy as much as actions do. And the world is watching. I say this with my own experience as the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs from September, 2015 to June, 2017. Sir, even the Ministrys name is constantly being changed. In November 2019, after the Presidential Election, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs became the Ministry of Foreign Relations. After the General Election in August, 2020, now it has become the Foreign Ministry. Actually, the Ministry certainly seems foreign now; it is an alien entity that is out of sync with reality, out of sync with international law and out of sync with the norms on which the current international system is based.

Mr. Presiding Member, diplomacy is about sincerity, honesty, speaking and acting with civility and responsibility towards ones own people as well as the world and engagement with international partners with confidence, respect and dignity. The way your own citizens are treated locally matters when dealing with the world because that speaks volumes about the nature of your Government as well as Sri Lanka, our nation.

Today, the Foreign Ministry is an institution, pardon me for saying this, in tatters. So is the Foreign Service. Servility seems to be the gold standard by which competence is measured. It is quite evident that servility has replaced meritocracy and capacity. I want to emphasize to the Hon. Minister that many honourable men and women are being sidelined and discarded at the Foreign Ministry. We must not let this institution be discredited in the eyes of the world. Let us consider some of the recent Ambassadorial appointments to most important capitals. I do not wish to mention individuals by name, but it is imperative that the right persons are sent to the key capitals of the world to represent us. I will take a few important examples to make the general point. A certain senior officer known to have worked with the media to misinform the public on Government policy and

caused harm to Sri Lankas relations with international partners during the former Government is being sent to an important capital. His services for the SLPP at elections certainly helped you win, but what is the message that is sent by such action to other civil servants and younger Foreign Service officers? I want to mention the name of Mr. A.L.A. Azeez, one of the finest and experienced professionals in the Sri Lanka Foreign Service who was Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva and who was suddenly recalled. Now, you are sending a complete outsider there. Will he be able to win the confidence of the UN Human Rights Caucus for the plan proposed by your Government?

Let me quote the Hon. Minister from his speech this morning. He said the proposal is to ''justifiably seek closure of matters related to Resolution 30/1 when it comes up for review in March, 2021.

He said he promised in February, 2020 in Geneva to appoint a Commission of Inquiry headed by a Justice of the Supreme Court to review the Reports of previous Sri Lankan COIs which investigated alleged violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law to assess the status of implementation of their recommendations and to propose deliverable measures to implement them keeping in line with the new Governments policy. I wonder what progress has been made on that. Has this COI been established? He did not mention. However, State Minister Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya, in reply to the Hon. Sumanthiran, said the Government will keep to its commitment.

Then, a person who worked for an investment group of a particular country and peddled fabrications on its pay to mislead the public about another countrys grant assistance to Sri Lanka is being sent as Sri Lankas Ambassador to the country for which he worked. Think about the messaging here. Should you actually do that? A person who openly insulted a particular friendly nation has been sent as High Commissioner to that same country.

I am making an exception and taking the liberty to mention the name of my classmate Mr. Asoka Moragoda, whom I have known for 50 years. Yes, I agree he possesses the diplomatic skills and the correct temperament to represent Sri Lanka, but it is shocking to see a Government which says that it adopts an India First policy keeps the High Commissioner post to India vacant for almost a year.

It is equally surprising to see the High Commissioner-designate, even after receiving confirmation of his appointment to India, still associating himself with his Pathfinder Foundation and tweeting with great delight about the signing of an MoU between his Pathfinder and the controversial Chinese company Huawei to collaborate in so-called cutting-edge ICT technologies in all spheres in Sri Lanka. I will reserve further comment on this most unusual "diplomatic" situation. Is this the way the Governments foreign policy Tsars treat our neighbouring countries? It looks more like a game of pitting one against another.

457 458

Mr. Presiding Member, let us look at the Governments Economic Diplomacy drive. I am glad that the Ministry is adding emphasis to the Economic Diplomacy drive that I started as Deputy Minister during the Hon. Minister Mangala Samaraweeras time. I am encouraged by the fact that the very able State Minister Tharaka Balasuriya has been entrusted with the task, I quote from the Performance Report of the Foreign Ministry which is on our Table, of Expanding the existing trading, investment and labour markets whilst looking for new opportunities with Asian and African countries to cultivate economic ties, to diversify export baskets. I wish him the very best in his endeavour. I encourage him to restart the 18-week online Economic Diplomacy Programme I started with the Centre for International Development at the Kennedy School of Harvard University.

That was a first for the University and a first for us. It was really successful with some 40 plus senior diplomats participating in the rigorous course to sharpen the skills needed for successful economic diplomacy. Sir, I would like to table* the Agreement we signed in March, 2017.

I wish to make an important note that economic diplomacy efforts should not be restricted just to Asia and Africa, as mentioned. The State Minister is capable. Give him a greater challenge.

Having said that, I wish to make a few rather disturbing observations. Economic diplomacy in contrast to what is being very strongly defined as distinct from something that is called political diplomacy at the Foreign Ministry is not mutually exclusive. That is incorrect. The political and the economic spheres are intertwined. So, why are we making this blunder? I hope the Government and the officials of the Ministry realize this soon. If not, the entire exercise will fail. Does the Government know that just asking countries to come and invest will not make credible private companies of stature to come here in droves?

Just talking about a "strategic location" will not make Sri Lanka a hub for anything. Saying we want to be friends with all and that we are non-aligned or neutral means nothing, if those words are not matched by action. The Government must realize that Sri Lanka can only benefit from its geographical location if we work with honesty, skill, dignity, transparency, pragmatism and wisdom to partner with all nations. Look at Singapore. Singapore too is a member of the Non-Aligned Movement. But, look at the maturity, pragmatism, and wisdom with which Singapore manages its relationships with the international community. Look at Vietnam, which is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement. See how that country works with all partners. Both countries, just last week, become members of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the

worlds largest trade agreement accounting for more than 30 per cent of global GDP. While we are raising our barbed-wire protected walls, they are widening their six-lane bridges. Being truly non-aligned in the post-Cold War context is to work honestly and with confidence with all partners without being defensive, protectionist and arrogant.

To be successful, the Government must also demonstrate that it places democracy, the rule of law, independent institutions and credible and transparent governance above individual self-interest and might I add, in our case, above the interest of one family.

In case the Foreign Ministry is not aware, economic diplomacy cannot be conducted in a vacuum, economic diplomacy is not a one-way street and the economy is linked to the political and the governance realms. Is it sound or sensible economic diplomacy to kick Sri Lankas long-standing development partner, Japan, which the previous speaker spoke highly of, in its face by cancelling the Light Rail Transit project with JICA funding? Does the Government expect Japanese investors to invest in this country in this backdrop? We understand that our Embassy staff met with the new Head of JICA in Tokyo this week. And what had he said? He had said that Sri Lanka is losing its credibility among Japanese officials, business and industry leaders and that it will lead to many disadvantages in the medium to long-term. That is what he had said. By the way, has the American gentleman from California still not taken up position as Colombos Ambassador to Tokyo?

One of the Governments key development platforms is Colombo Port City and the proposed International Financial City therein. As a person who was involved in preparing the legal and financial incentive framework for the Port City Special Economic Zone and as the Chairman of the Steering Committee during the last year of the previous Government, I know it is absolutely essential for Sri Lanka to be above board on money laundering allegations to attract the right kind of investor. I am sure the Government remembers that Sri Lanka was placed in the blacklist of the Financial Action Task Force in 2011 and categorized as a dangerous country in 2012. A lot of people do not know this. Most people do not know that it was finally in 2016 and 2017, through the hard work by the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance and the Foreign Ministry that Sri Lanka managed to be recognized as a cooperating State to be placed on the a grey list and work its way out of the grey list in 2019. Following the lead of the FATF, the European Commission also placed Sri Lanka on the blacklist at the time.

Through diligent work, Sri Lanka enhanced its Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism Standards to improve compliance and elevate Sri Lankas standing to get Sri Lanka out of the EU Blacklist. That too, Hon. Minister, is economic diplomacy and that kind of work requires hard, painstaking, diligent and honest work. Throwing words around, cutting deals or issuing press releases threatening or criticizing international institutions and demonizing certain countries will not

459 460

[ () ]

2020 25

help Sri Lanka become a hub for anything. That will not get Sri Lanka anywhere except isolate our country on the international stage, reducing its stature and weakening the countrys economy.

The Governments present action, particularly providing the opportunity for racketeers to bring, I quote the words used in the Hon. Prime Minister's Budget Speech, funds hidden locally and internationally" by paying just 1 per cent tax on the entire booty risks Sri Lanka being placed on a grey or blacklist once again, eroding the credibility of Sri Lankas banking and financial system. That will put an end to the planned Financial City.

On a separate matter, take the ongoing fraud case of Sri Lankas former Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Jaliya Wickramasuriya, where the Government has informed the US Government that he cannot be investigated for allegations of money laundering and continued to enjoy diplomatic immunity. But "The Sunday Times" last week on its front page stated that the US had dismissed the immunity reinstated by the new Government. Does the Foreign Ministry expect that this kind of conduct will create confidence in investors or lending agencies? Is this what the Foreign Ministry calls sound economic diplomacy? Economic diplomacy, Sir, will fail if we demonize certain countries and international organizations, as I said before, in the eyes of the Sri Lankan public and lie to the Sri Lankan public about the motivations of some countries and international organizations just to win their votes.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , 2 .

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Okay. Thank you.

This is what the SLPP did, sadly aided and abetted by some senior Foreign Service officials, in respect of Sri Lankas relations with the US MCC Compact. This is what they did with respect to the East Container Terminal Agreement involving India and Japan as well. It was the same with the Light Rail Transit project with Japan. Sadly, the Government and the people have trapped themselves now in a bind.

Who are the losers in the long run? The people of this country, both present and future generations. Why is the Government so afraid of working with democratic nations and international organizations that call for measures that will help Sri Lanka establish credentials to attract sound investment and enhance trade? Does the Government not know that global standards of free trade and a fair investment climate will benefit business and help attract credible and high-quality investments into the country? The talks about Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour mention the development of a strong trade relationship with Asian countries. But obviously, these are only just

words because the Sri Lanka - Singapore FTA remains unimplemented, while key economies have conducted, like I said, Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreements.

Since I am running out of time, I must say that this kind of talk and action that do not match their words make observers wonder whether for the Government, "Asia" means just China and the "world" also means just China and China alone. For a moment, I am not devaluing the partnership with China. China has been and will continue to be an important partner in our future. Just a bit of history, Sir, in fact, it was during the period of Dudley Senanayake that the Ceylon-China Trade Agreement, better known as the Rubber-Rice Pact, was signed in 1952 to overcome the severe impact of crashing commodity prices. As the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella mentioned this morning, it was China who came to our aid and negotiated the exchange of rice for rubber when the US did not agree to our request to grant us a UD Dollars 50 million loan.

Sir, parroting the words friendship with all, enmity with none is not enough; saying that we are following the "Kalyana Mithra" policy is not enough. Actions must prove it. We must engage with the world. We must leverage on our comparative advantages. Trade is good, not evil.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, please give me two more minutes. I will finish.

In fact, our success depends on how best we utilize our hugely important geographic location. Sir, I am going to skip some sections of my speech, which I would like table*. But finally, I want to mention one important point.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, please give me one more minute.

If anyone in the Foreign Ministry or the Government cared to read the Geneva Resolution carefully, what we spoke about earlier this morning, they would have understood that what the was Government committed to do in October, 2015 was exactly that, to set up domestic mechanisms.

461 462

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

The Hon. Minister spoke about what he was planning to do. I hope, he will continue to do what he proposed here and what he has promised to the international community and not take us back to the pre-2015 era.

Anyway, Sir, in conclusion, I appreciate the efforts taken by Foreign Ministry to repatriate our citizens stuck overseas due to the pandemic. But, I urge the Hon. Minister to pay special attention to the tens of thousands of our poor labourers stranded in the Middle East.

I wish the Hon. Minister and the State Minister well. As a responsible Opposition, we remain ready to help. Thank you very much.

Mr. Presiding Member, we live in a very connected, inter-dependent world, some say. But, COVID-19 has shown us that States are on their own when it comes to the challenge at the end of the day. It is, therefore, important for us to build a homegrown, our own organic policy towards foreign affairs. It makes me to say that Sri Lanka, being a small State, needs a smart foreign policy framework. This smartness should be seen in our security, our economic diplomacy, our culture and in knowledge exchange. Why a small State like Sri Lanka should be a smart State is based on two key factors: one is, structural and long-term and the other is, short-term and conjunctional. The most obvious reason for such a call is the misplaced foreign policies of the previous regime that gave away the sovereignty and the independency of my motherland unconditionally, at times. Such overtly "satisfying the Western" policies seriously compromised, insecuritized and infringed on our sovereignty. We have to move away from that framework. - [Interruption.] Let me finish this, Sir. We can debate this later. We have to move forward with a more sophisticated, systematic approach in our foreign policies. - [Interruption.] Yes, I corrected some of the mistakes you made. I went to Geneva in 2019 and fought against the 2015 Resolution. I corrected some of the things that you did. - [Interruption.] Exactly. Because it was against the Tamil people, it was against Sri Lanka and it was against the Sinhalese people, that I -

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

() ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Thank you, Sir.

463 464

2020 25

We have to move forward with a more sophisticated, systematic approach in our foreign policies, first, with our immediate neighbour India and then, with our neighbour China. Politically, clearly it will be Sri Lanka first, the neighbours, next and with the rest, we need to live and move forward.

Our 157 foreign Missions, High Commissions, Embassies and Consulates have the ability to become promoters of Sri Lanka for diversified investments, tourism and cultural exchange. This economic diplomacy strategically needs to be persuaded with vigour and commitment. I would even suggest that we should give investment targets to each of our Missions so that they can promote Sri Lanka as a destiny for investments. During the 29 years, the terrible separatist war did bring influence from ideologies and Western interests to my motherland and to all communities. Yes, we have to learn from our mistakes. But, such learnings necessarily must come up with an organic way of doing things; a homegrown solution is what we are looking at. To deepen our democracy, we should continue to have dialogues with our political aspirations. Therefore, I would invite the Representatives of Tamil nationalism - I will also contribute - to take realities into account and sit down to have our own mechanism, to find a Sri Lankan solution and not to run to Western corners where they have their own interests. And that divide-and-rule policy had been there for the last 200, 300 years played against the global south, as we very clearly know.

Transitional justice cannot be merely a word used for the narrow ends of one party. It should go beyond transitional justice. Sir, we should talk about reconciliational justice; we should talk about distributive justice; we should talk about cultural and knowledge justice in this country so that my motherland will be healed, so that the Sinhalese, Tamils, our sisters and brothers can sit down and talk about our issues eye-to-eye without any foreign interpreters in between. Our aim should be not to allow foreign interventions to use us against each other.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

() ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Thank you.

Instead, we can find a common ground so that we can sit down and talk with each other without arrogance, as the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris reminded us in the morning. Without arrogance from the West, without arrogance from our own mistakes and without talking about the unrealistic past, either side needs to sit down and talk so that our children and their children's children will live in one undivided and undividable Sri Lanka as proud citizens.

The comparison between Sri Lanka and countries like Singapore needs to be stopped because anybody who knows about this countrys history will not do such mistakes. Singapore is a city State with a small history. We respect that country, but comparing Singapore to Sri Lanka is a mistake that no Sri Lankan should make because our anthropology, our history and our culture are more complex than theirs.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . () ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Therefore, these foreign policy debates should be in that context.

I am aware how some learned Hon. Members who are here are trying to use my speech and I am sure that by evening, this will be on diaspora media, that I am speaking against them. No, I am not speaking against any nation. I want to work towards a united Sri Lanka, a unitary Sri Lanka where the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and all of us can share and call ourselves proud Sri Lankans.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 13 .

[2.50 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, I would like to begin with what the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris in his eloquent speech this morning referred to when it came to the UN Charter. The UN Charter, no doubt, talks about the equality of sovereign States. Similarly, the UN has recognized the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which recognizes the inherent dignity of the human being. So, individuals and their inherent rights also have got to be respected by sovereign States. Going by what the former Governor of the Northern Province who spoke just before me said, the cultural rights of the people too have got to be recognized and respected by individual sovereign States.

Our Constitution lays down that the sovereignty is in the people. It is not just a matter of vesting the sovereignty in the people, but it is in the people themselves; nobody needs to vest it in the people. And sovereignty includes Executive power, Legislative power, Judicial power and also franchise and fundamental rights.

465 466

This is what our Constitution states. So, when it comes to the fundamental rights, there again I go back to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the way in which the ICCPR - International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - describes the dignity of individuals. Now, in this regard, I would like to interestingly refer to a news item that appeared way back in 2012. The Sunday Times political column published an imaginary incident to draw attention to the state of affairs in the then Government. In that process, they brought me also into some ridicule.

The imaginary incident they referred to goes like this. At the maritime security conference held in Galle, Mr. Hakeem, the Minister of Justice was seated at the same table where another VIP calling himself the "Minister of Maritime Security" from Switzerland was seated. Somewhat perplexed, Mr. Hakeem inquired from the guest, 'How come you have a Ministry for Maritime Security in Switzerland which is a landlocked country?' The guest, thereafter rethought and said, 'Mr. Hakeem, you better explain how, how come you could be a Minister of Justice in a country without any justice?' " Though it was a joke at my expense, the moral of the story is certainly relevant to the current times too. - [Interruption.] I have also gone to Geneva in defence of the regime who is now sitting in the seats of power at the time when I was the Minister of Justice and even to date, people like the Hon. Sumanthiran and others keep criticizing me for having done my duty then as the Minister of Justice.

Sir, then I would like to refer to another matter. I am talking of the dignity of the living. The question of the dignity of the dead is a matter of contention. I have, in fact, interjected in this regard when the Hon. Minister of Foreign spoke and referred to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in this House two days ago. All the Resident Ambassadors representing those countries here appealed to His Excellency the President to reconsider the "cremation only" policy regarding the COVID -19 victims. That request has so far not been acceded to. A few days ago, the UN Resident Representative also referred to this incident and appealed to reconsider that in the light of the fact that the WHO has very clearly permitted both options of burial and cremation. In this regard, it is very important for me to say this. Continuing with the "cremation only" policy has traumatized a section of this nation. That is not simply a denial of their fundamental right to be treated with dignity, but also it goes to endanger communal harmony. We have kept on urging the Government to revise this draconian Gazette which is patently discriminatory given the fact that the decision is not based on reliable evidence and supported by any plausible scientific reason.

Sir, I would also like to refer here to a forensic pathologist attached to the Minister of Health. He goes to the extent of telling the BBC that he fears that a COVID-19 victim and his body could be used as a biological weapon. I do not know how he has come to this preposterous decision on us, the Muslims in this country

converting a COVID - 19 dead into a biological weapon. You must understand that to convert the COVID virus into a biological weapon, you must at least have a Biological Safety Level 3 lab, which is only available at the MRI and in two universities. How can that be falling into the hands of Muslims in this country to create a biological weapon out of a COVID - 19 dead? This is how preposterously racist attitudes are shown by some of the so-called men who are urging and criticizing the people who are asking for their legitimate right to give the dead at least their dignity, to be buried with dignity. We are fraught with all kinds of ghosts and bogeymen who are posing as experts. Is this the way in which this Government is treating this hapless Muslims in this country?

We have always been asking for this with utmost respect and pleading with this Government to reconsider this draconian Gazette which has to be revised in the light of scientific evidence.

Yesterday, the WHO has very clearly said that while swimming in a swimming pool, a COVID-19-affected person cannot transmit the disease through water. That, again, has been proved yesterday through a circular by the World Health Organization. This being the case and since our friends of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Amnesty International, the European Union and various other international organizations have also made this fervant plea, I once again very respectfully urge that you consider this.

Sir, let me also come to the other issue of the ICCPR Act. The ICCPR Act talks about hate speech and has provided a provision through which you can punish those people who engage in hate speech. Now, what is happening in this country? That particular provision is being used in breach, I would say, to punish innocent people who make a post on the social media. This morning, the Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya, on behalf of the JVP, spoke about the case of Ramzy Razik, an innocent journalist who had been held under custody under the ICCPR Act for several months. It so happened there was a young progressive Sinhala short story writer too, having written a short story, was kept in prison for several days because his right to express his opinion freely has been curtailed by the very provision which we brought in to curtail hate speech in this country. I cannot understand how, when it hurts the people in power, they are using this for their own parochial purpose than to use it for the right purpose to stop hate speech in this country.

Sir, these are the issues I thought that I should refer to, but since I have a little more time, let me also refer to a comment made my good Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva about our High Commissioner designate to New Delhi, my good friend, Mr. Milinda Moragoda. I beg to disagree with the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva. Mr. Milinda Moragoda, yes, is, in fact, behind the Pathfinder Foundation which has done yeomen service and good work as a think tank in this country. They organized the Pathfinder Indian Ocean Security Conference 2020 recently, through, of course, a virtual conference. Our new Foreign Secretary happens to be an Admiral, but I

467 468

[ ]

2020 25

am sure that he does not have the luxury of engaging in gunboat diplomacy because we are not a military power to be engaged in gunboat diplomacy. I must say our Foreign Secretary is a very articulate person; he has participated in so many conferences abroad. Be that as it may, what is important is to have people like Mr. Milinda Moragoda because I have had the pleasure of serving with him in the team which negotiated with the LTTE on behalf of the Government.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Okay.

I have had the pleasure of serving with Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris and Mr. Milinda Moragoda in negotiating with the LTTE in the six rounds of Peace Talks and we found Mr. Moragoda's experience, ability and negotiation skills were so useful for this country. He is somebody who has immense experience in dealing with multilateral agencies and donor countries with his international connections. I am sure the position in New Delhi is a very important position. We have never had Foreign Service officers serving in New Delhi; we have had political appointees in the past as well. Of course, what happened to our Foreign Service Officer and very esteemed gentleman who served in Delhi, Mr. Prasad Kariyawasam? When he came back, he joined the Speakers Office and unfortunately, these very people in the Government started criticizing him.

Such a good officer who had an unblemished record, a wonderful officer, came in for criticism. So, let us not throw brickbats at people just to suit our convenience as and when people are taking up positions. Of course, the Speakers Office is a neutral office. In that office, having somebody like Prasad Kariyawasam serving is a good thing for the entire Parliament. But, unfortunately, they looked at it through partisan eyes. And similarly, I would ask that Mr. Milinda Moragodas appointment also be not criticized because he is somebody who has immense knowledge. At the time when we dealt with the LTTE, it was important for us. Though Delhi was not directly involved, all the other capitals were involved.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Okay.

We had Washington, Brussels, Oslo and Tokyo involved actively on behalf of the international

community. Those were well coordinated discussions with the LTTE though the LTTE was very intransigent and finally paid the price. That being the case, I would say, Mr. Milinda Moragodas appointment was a good one, a correct one though there were some people even on the side of the Government, those who supported the Government, criticizing his appointment because they did not think that he was going to favour their ideology. This is not a position to favour somebodys ideology or somebody elses ideology, but to work for the benefit of the nation.

Saying that, I thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 8 .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. You have 12 minutes. [3.20 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, it gives me great pleasure to say a few words on the Vote of the Ministry of Foreign. The Hon Minister is someone that I have grown to respect. My late father was extremely respectful of him, he was very fond of him and their relationship goes back a long way. Likewise, the State Minister of Regional Co-operation, the Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya and myself have a common alma mater and our personal relationship also goes back a long way and I sincerely hope that my personal views on the two important individuals who steer this Ministry do not, in any way, colour the duty that I am supposed to discharge in dealing with this Vote.

Hon. Presiding Member, the Annual Action Plan of the Ministry of Foreign for 2020, under "Duties and Functions", under item No. 08, states that one of the duties is to make a study of geopolitical tendencies and advise the Government on strategies to be adopted in the management of such tendencies in a manner beneficial to the interest of Sri Lanka. In the similar spirit, I recall the Foreign Secretary in one of the conferences stating somewhat correctly, I would say, that it must be the duty of the Foreign Ministry and the Government to make sure, as Sri Lanka is a geopolitical hotspot and is a strategically important country, that Sri Lanka is not made a political football where great powers compete and ultimately Sri Lanka stands to lose. I am paraphrasing. Those were not the exact words, but that is certainly the spirit in which he made those comments. That actually is how Sri Lankas Foreign Policy ought to have played out. The fact that Sri Lanka is geopolitically a very important country is not rocket science and it is not a secret. The fact that during World War II, the Allied Forces had their Eastern Naval Command based in Trincomalee in Sri Lanka clearly shows that for decades, if not for time immemorial, that Sri Lanka belongs to the Indian Ocean and its location dictates its importance. But the question is, how has this importance been used? What has the Sri Lankan State done with its Foreign Policy and how has it used it to the advantage of what the Foreign Ministry calls "Sri Lanka"? Here is where I think things start deteriorating because it is a tragedy. In my view, it is a

473 474

tragedy. Sri Lanka has used its strategic importance since 1948 to try and undermine its own population or a section of its own population, particularly the Tamil people.

Sri Lankas Foreign Policy since 1948 has been to look at India with suspicion because India, with a massive Tamil population in its southern flanks, will naturally be quite concerned about the Tamil population in this Island.

And, therefore, it has catered a Foreign Policy to contain Indias interests and they have been doing that in many ways and its climax was in the 1980s when President Jayewardene chose to lean towards the United States. At that time, it was a Cold War situation where India, although non-aligned, nonetheless had very close relationships with the USSR and Sri Lanka chose to tilt heavily towards the United States and what happened thereafter, I think ,we all know. Sri Lanka became destabilized; it became destabilized to the point where India very openly took the side of the Tamil armed struggle and the Tamil struggle for their rights. Ultimately, it came to a point where Sri Lanka had to sign the Indo-Lanka Accord and a good part of that Accord -its annexures - although the mainstream part of the Accord talks of a solution to the Tamil national question, very clearly show that Sri Lanka ultimately have to, in some way, surrender to Indias strategic interests.

Again, under President Mahinda Rajapaksas regime, with this sort of drunkenness to somehow prevent Tamil rights from being recognized and refusing to come to some sort of political settlement with the Tamil national struggle, Sri Lanka chose to align itself with China. That is a country that does not meddle around with the internal affairs of countries, which is well known, whereas countries like India, the United States and western countries tend to put conditions on human rights and insist that Sri Lanka commit itself to plurality. So, what did Sri Lanka do? Sri Lanka went the other way; Sri Lanka tilted towards China. Sri Lanka had to tilt towards China to such an extent that again, today, Sri Lanka has lost its ability to take decisions on its own. That is the reality. The Hon. Minister and the Hon. State Minister might be compelled to deny that, but that is the reality. You tilted to such an extent to China in order to prevent Tamil rights, your own fellow citizens rights. You would rather not accept that Sri Lanka is big enough for all of us to live as equals. Sri Lanka is not only the homeland of the Sinhala Buddhists, by all means. It must be the homeland of the Sinhala Buddhists, but it is also the homeland of the Tamils and the Muslims.

There are several nations in this country. Tamils are not opposed to the Sinhalese. We do not deny the Sinhala nationhood. We do not deny that Buddhism has to be protected. We do not deny any of that. But, why are you denying other identities? It is that drunkenness and that need to deny so heavily that Sri Lanka is a plurinational country that made you compromise your own sovereignty to a point that you have to sell strategic assets to China today.

Therefore, Hon. Presiding Member, I wish to state this. For as long as Sri Lanka refuses to recognize Tamil rights and Muslims rights and insists that this country only belongs to the Sinhala Buddhists, for as long as you keep going down that path, you will have to play the geopolitical game and the more you play that game, you must remember, we would once again go into a polarized world. You will create enemies and when you create enemies, those enemies will look for leverage. Tamil rights might be denied by you today; you might even colonize the North-East to a point that the Tamil nation might become a non-entity - that is called genocide, by other means - but one thing is for sure, that the geopolitical contestations that you are playing with today will also make sure that you get destroyed. Mark my words, it will make sure that you get destroyed. The day you begin to shed communalism and racism, the day you begin to recognize that the Tamils are as much owners of this land in the North-East as you are in the rest of the country, the day you begin to cooperate is the day that you play this geopolitical game in a proper way where all of us can benefit and it does not, in fact, become a zero-sum game. Even though we might be willing to cooperate with you, for as long as you refuse to, it is you who will also be defeated ultimately. Make no mistake. That is not something that you can ever run away from.

Today, you are antagonizing, even though you might not formally accept it, India; you are antagonizing the United States. I am not saying that you should not work with China. By all means you must, but if you compromise your strategic assets, if the relationship becomes one of a strategic nature, which China has made itself into, then you are in this dangerous game and will spiral to a zero-sum game. And you might deny Tamil rights, but you will also deny your own citizens of the sovereignty that you so proudly say that you stand for.

Thank you.

It is through the Foreign Ministry that the policies of this Government and the development programmes are taken to the world and that any international aid or loans have to be obtained for development. We have always followed a middle path - - or held a non- aligned stance. But now, with the trade war turning into a cold war - - between the United States and China, how would our Foreign Ministry manage our affairs? What is the balance? How will we balance India? , a seasoned politician has been sent as High Commissioner to Delhi, India. However, it is for the first time in the history of this country that a person who held a Cabinet rank has been made a High Commissioner.

Europe has given us a warning about becoming a closed economy. We are highly dependent on trade with Europe. , more than 60 per cent of our trade is being done with Europe. GSP Plus plays a crucial, a major role. I remember, during the last Government, it was with greatest difficulty that we were able to get back the GSP Plus facility; . , garment factories. Most of our export are to the USA. The Ministry of Foreign will have to facilitate and further expand our exports without upsetting China. How will we do this? These are questions that the current Government will have to face.

Sir, the airports and ports are closed today. That sends a clear message to the world that Sri Lanka is closed for business; . , it is imperative that all related Ministries and Ministers set up a Joint Committee together with the Ministry of Health. , if one has a valid PCR test report taken within 72 hours, that person is allowed to come into that country. They are required to be self- isolated only for about three to four days just to check. So, I would like to suggest to the Hon. Minister that it is also important for our tourism industry to set up such a system or have a rigid system put in place so that when we eventually open Sri Lanka for businesses and tourism and when foreigners do come, they would come with a valid 72-hour PCR test report.

Repatriation of Sri Lankans is another subject. More than 1.6 million Sri Lankans are working overseas. I am asking the Hon. Foreign Minister to ensure that all those who want to come back to Sri Lanka or who are trapped in those counties are brought back to Sri Lanka under the repatriation programme. It is very, very important. What is the plan, we must ask? When they come back to Sri Lanka, will the Foreign Ministry make arrangements to pay them compensation for the loss of salaries? Many of them are stuck in those countries without salaries and some are complaining that they do not even have food to eat.

I am not going to talk too much about the Geneva Resolutions since the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella also talked

about them in the morning. But all I want to say is, in coming March, 2021, we will again have to face the music in regard to Geneva Resolutions. Having professionals in the Foreign Service is a must; giving a training for our young Foreign Service bureaucrats is a must. With regard to the functioning of our Sri Lankan Embassies abroad, the professionals attached to those must be given the right training and briefing for them to take the Government policies forward and if you want to attract foreign investments, how they should do that.

The other contentious issue, Sir, is the political appointments.

, . , Embassies hope that they will be allocated with duties. However, I wish to bring to the notice of the Hon. Minister that there is a bone of contention among these officials that they are not getting their due places. Therefore, I would ask the Hon. Minister and the State Minister to look into this. I do not want to mention their names. But, there is another allegation that - promotions - . . . , .

If we do not protect our seas from being raped by large foreign vessels, we will follow in the footsteps of countries like Somalia where fishermen turn to piracy because it is no longer viable for them to go out and start fishing. So, if we deplete our seas, we will also have to follow in the footsteps of Somalia. , . .

, about Counter Terrorism Bill versus the Prevention of Terrorism Act . Hon. Minister, both of us know how we tackled that issue and what pressures we came under. However, in the future, I would suggest that we do some amendments to the Prevention of Terrorism Act and I would be glad to help. We have about 14 amendments which we made at our Committee to the original Bill that came from the Cabinet. I would suggest that we amend the Prevention of Terrorism Act as well.

[4.34 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya - State Minister of Regional Co-operation) Mr. Presiding Member, I was hoping to make my speech in Sinhala. But, before I do so, I want to adress and answer certain queries raised by certain Hon. Members of Parliament at the outset.

I think the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, a senior Member of this House, made the comment that the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa and Mr. Ban Ki-moon signed an Agreement, which was a very nefarious statement aimed at misleading this House and I want to reiterate that there was no such Agreement signed by the former President and the former Secretary-General of the United Nations. I do not want to speak anymore further on that.

I also want to make a comment on a remark made by the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran although he is not present here. He spoke very eloquently. We know that the Hon. Sumanthiran is a wordsmith and he tries to put words in our mouth. He made the point that the last Government made a genuine attempt for devolution. But, I want to remind the Hon. Sumanthiran that it is very unfortunate that they - he was the architect of that attempt to bring in a new Constitution - failed at the outset when they failed to bring in even a Bill and that the United National Party, which was a leading coalition partner, did not even put forward their suggestions relating to constitutional changes to the Steering Committee. So I think, in a way, the Hon. Sumanthiran also managed to hoodwink the people as much as the United National Party managed to hoodwink the entire nation.

Then, my Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva said that we are confused about our foreign policy and also made comments about the changes in the name of the Ministry. I think changing the name of a Ministry is not a new thing. If you look at the Auditor-Generals Department, the name of that institution has changed several times, but the function of it has remained the same. So, I do not think that it is of major importance.

I also want to bring to his attention that for the first time in Sri Lanka, we have a 20-point foreign policy directive. The 20-point foreign policy directive has been

based on the Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour, the economic plan of His Excellency the President. So, whatever foreign policy decisions that we take will be based on that 20-point foreign policy directive.

The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva also stated that Sri Lanka had been included in the Grey List in 2011. I checked up on it. I believe that Sri Lanka was included in the Grey List in October, 2017.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Hon. State Minister, I can table that document. Sri Lanka was brought into the Grey List in 2011 and to the Danger List, in 2012. We started getting out of it in 2017 and got out of it in 2019.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) I stand to be corrected. I do not want to argue on that matter.

The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva also made reference to the militarization of the Foreign Ministry. I believe that it is because the Secretary to the Ministry was a former Admiral and a Commander of the Navy. I think it is not a fair statement. If you particularly take into consideration his qualifications, he has a PhD, an MSc. in Strategic Studies, an MA in International Studies, a Diploma in World Affairs and he has been a lecturer in international relations in universities in China, Japan, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. So, I feel that it is not a fair statement to categorize -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) In fact, we have no problem at all with Prof. Colombage. I am told that he is a very genial person as well. The only issue is, he is the only person using the title Admiral. If he is a retired Admiral, then he has to use the word retired. Usually that is the practice. He is the Chief Accounting Officer of the Ministry, which is a civilian organization. There are other Secretaries who are former military officers. But, they do not use their former military titles. That is the only point I was making.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Okay. Your point is well taken.

Also, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva commented on the appointment of Mr. Milinda Moragoda as the Ambassador designate to India. I also want to comment on the Hon. Rauff Hakeems speech, in which he was gracious enough to acknowledge the fact that a person of the calibre of Mr. Milinda Moragoda will be an asset to any government. His vast experience will come in handy. I just had lunch with him yesterday and we discussed an array of things. I have no doubt that he will perform his duties for the benefit all Sri Lankans.

, . , . But, a non-aligned policy does not mean a non-active foreign policy. So, I think we need to ensure that there is an active foreign policy and we engage with all countries, which is what we have been doing for the last few months.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. State Minister, your time is up. ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Okay, Sir.

In my concluding remarks, I want to thank the Hon. Minister whose years of experience has come in handy and whose guidance is always welcome. He has always been there to guide the Ministry and myself. Therefore, I would like to give my sincere thanks to the Hon. Minister, the Secretary and the staff of the Foreign Ministry. I think I will fail in my duty if I do not mention that we have some of the brightest minds at the Foreign Ministry when compared to the other Ministries. So, I am very pleased that there is a good staff to work with and there is a lot of work to do.

I also want to mention that the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva told me about the programme he started with the Harvard University. I also invited him to come to the Ministry to see the progress of what he initiated.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. State Minister, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Please, give me one more minute, Sir.

So, we do not need to reinvent the wheel all over again. Whatever good stuff the previous Government had started, we intend to continue. Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, I think we already set an appointment, but we could not meet up. Once this Budget Debate is over, we will set a time again to meet and you can advise us on the good things you have done and we definitely intend to continue with the same.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! , .
