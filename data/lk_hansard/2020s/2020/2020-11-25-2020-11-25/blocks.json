As given by His Excellency the President, the vision of the Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour is to achieve the fourfold outcome of a productive citizenry, a contented family, a disciplined and just society and a prosperous nation. Our commitment to safeguard the mandate of the people and their vision of Sri Lanka as a Unitary State that enjoys sovereignty, independence, security, territorial integrity, human rights, democracy and prosperity remains unwavered. It was on this basis that, as the Foreign Minister representing Sri Lanka, I spoke before the Human Rights Council of the United Nations in Geneva this February and withdrew Sri Lanka from the co-sponsorship of Resolution 30/1, which had cast upon Sri Lanka an obligation to infringe the sovereignty of the people, violate the Constitution and the democratic principles of governance and compel Sri Lanka to turn its backs on the very heroes who delivered us from the 30 years of turmoil and strife.",

Lakshman Kiriella was blaming President Mahinda Rajapaksa for agreeing with the Secretary-General of the UN on the 26th of May, 2009 in Kandy, undertaking to inquire into the allegations of human rights violations. And for his part, the Hon. Minister was blaming the main Opposition for co-sponsoring, when they were in Office, Resolution HRC 30/1 before the UN Human Rights Commission. These acts are not acts of certain governments that are in office at a particular point in time. These undertakings are given on behalf of the State and in the international system these obligations are taken very seriously. The Minister read out the letter sent in February this year claiming to withdraw from the co-sponsorship of HRC Resolution 30/1. All of us know that you cannot withdraw from an act that is already done. The Minister was hurt to say in this House that that co-sponsorship happened without the knowledge of anyone, not even the President at that time. I want to ask a question. If that be so, how did Sri Lanka co-sponsor Resolutions 34/1 and 40/1 several months thereafter, both of which were merely rollover Resolutions of 30/1? Resolution 30/1 was done on the 1st of October, 2015; Resolution 34/1 was in March, 2017 and Resolution 40/1 was in March, 2019 - three times over, the same contents. How does a responsible Minister stand up here and say that nobody knew about the contents? These undertakings are on behalf of Sri Lanka - of the State. There are serious repercussions if you resile from international commitments.",

Why did he do that? Will you now write a letter to the UN Secretary-General withdrawing from this commitment that your President made on the 26th of May, 2009? He said, \"Not only the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment\". Eleven years have passed and that has not been implemented. Your leaders solemn promise to the Secretary-General of the UN, no less! I am saying this because there are repercussions if you do not deliver on your promises to the international community. You pride yourself that we are a part of the civilized community of nations. We will not be part of a civilized community of nations if we willy-nilly ignore and violate commitments that we make to the international community. I am only referring to his guarantee of implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment and going beyond that. But, there are other agreements in that with regard to violation of human rights and that there will be a domestic mechanism. In your letter in February this year too, you say that there will be a domestic mechanism. Where is it? Several months have passed, but where is that plan? For 11 years, you fooled the world and now, for 11 months also, you have fooled the world or you think that you can fool all the people all the time. That is what you think. Then, on the very next day after President Mahinda Rajapaksa agreed with that, on the 27th of May, 2009, at the UN Human Rights Council a Resolution was adopted which stated, Welcoming also the recent assurance given by the President of Sri Lanka.... - the previous day, he gave that assurance - \".....that he does not regard a military solution as a final solution as well as his commitment to a political solution with the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to bring about lasting peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka,\".

These dispatches were ferreted out with the greatest difficulty, as the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena pointed out, by personages of the eminence of Lord Michael Naseby both within the House of Lords and outside. There were also very critical findings by Queens Counsels of the eminence of Sir Desmond de Silva, Sir Geoffrey Nice and Rodney Dixon. These findings completely exonerated the armed forces of Sri Lanka from any form of culpability or guilt with regard to war crimes under principles of International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law. So, this document, this body of evidence was there. It was never taken into account; it was deliberately ignored. This was done in the lofty name of human rights.

    "text": "Can such an important and crucial regulatory mechanism be implemented or established within two weeks? The Members present at that Committee - some of whom are in the Chamber today - had also made references to legislation recently passed in Singapore as an example of what could be followed in Sri Lanka. Now, it has become quite common, as you know, for Singapore to be held up as the \"model\" for Sri Lanka for all things that we need to do. When we do so, when we hold up Singapore as the model, we tend to overlook the fact that it is an extremely tightly controlled society where the idea of dissent and protest so essential for democracy is not tolerated. Just recently, it was reported that a Singaporean man was arrested for unlawful assembly for holding a placard with a smiley face in front of a police station. Internet freedom is limited in Singapore and the Government has high powers of censorship, which it uses to stifle criticism and opposition views. Is this what we aspire to? I do not think so. Sri Lankan citizens are highly politically literate and any regulatory mechanism that attempts to stifle the freedom to debate and engage with political ideas would be highly detrimental to our democratic space. While there is a legitimate concern of how digital media platforms can distort information, propagate hate speech et cetera far more dangerously than traditional media, this move by the Government to introduce regulatory mechanisms is of deep concern because the actions of this Government and the Governments historically in Sri Lanka suggest that their intentions are not to regulate, but rather to stifle dissent and the views of its critics while giving a free licence to their own supporters to attack their political opponents. For example, many of us have been victims of fake posts on social media platforms. Several of us have filed complaints with the CID regarding this, but none have been investigated satisfactorily. Yet, social media commentators like Ramzy Razeek, who was arrested under the ICCPR and Computer Crimes Act and is currently on bail, was arrested after he made a complaint of threats he received on something he had said in social media.",

Criticism of the Government is interpreted as fake news, distortion and malicious and prompt action is taken, whereas pro-Government media is allowed to say or do whatever it wants about the Opposition or critics of the Government. Thus, there are legitimate fears when the Government says it wants to regulate media, since our experience is that under the guise of regulations, what the Government is seeking to do is to actually suppress dissent and critique. We cannot ignore the fact that there are many occupying extremely powerful positions in this Government, who are allegedly associated with the disappearance, intimidation and even deaths of media persons. At no point has this Government shown that it is tolerant of criticism and dissent, but rather the reaction to criticism has been highly defensive and aggressive. The ethos is one of intolerances and that is hardly conducive to freedom of expression. The intension of the Government, therefore, to establish within two weeks a regulatory mechanism for websites is truly worrying. If such a move is envisaged, then at the very least, the Government needs to engage in a consultative proses to obtain the views of all concerned.",

(Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya's contribution, I think it is very unfortunate that her Party Leader has not included her in the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Mass Media. In fact, all these moves were discussed at the Consultative Committee. Particularly, it is not a move by me and that was discussed at length; it took one and a half hours and I think it was one of the longest sessions we had. At that, one of the Members of the Committee suggested that there should be some kind of monitoring of social media. When I was the Minister then, we had numerous discussions as to how you deal with this situation. Firstly, as a primary move, we discussed that all social media institutions should be registered under the Ministry of Mass Media. That is exactly what we discussed. It has been misinformed completely that we are going to have a monitoring body with regard to Facebook and so on. But, it was just a registration, to which all the Members agreed at that time, they said to safeguard their dignity and we only had a debate over the fees. We proposed Rs. 100,000 as the registration fee and Rs. 25,000 as the annual fee, where they requested to make the registration fee Rs. 25,000 and the annual fee Rs. 5,000, to which we readily agreed even in 2014. Unfortunately, during last five years, nothing happed. Therefore, we took it up at the first Consultative Committee Meeting and there were so many things that came out of it at the Consultative Committee. So, that is exactly what was discussed. I am sure the Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Amarasuriya was completely misled and it is a question of misinformation. I think some Members of her Party also participated in the Consultative Committee. I am extremely sorry that her Party Leader has not included such an eloquent and informed lady, who has been a Member of this House, in the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Mass Media.",

It does not look like its sound-bite diplomacy is working. At times, they call it neutral and at others, they call it non-aligned. Then, sometimes, they call it India first and at other times, Sri Lanka first\" with a focus on Asia. This morning, the affable Minister said that now it is called Kalyana Mithra Policy. Does the Government know that each of these phrases mean something? Does it know that the world is listening to what is being said? Does it know that diplomacy and Foreign Policy is not just about words, but words being followed through with actions?",

Does the Foreign Ministry expect that this kind of conduct will create confidence in investors or lending agencies? Is this what the Foreign Ministry calls sound economic diplomacy? Economic diplomacy, Sir, will fail if we demonize certain countries and international organizations, as I said before, in the eyes of the Sri Lankan public and lie to the Sri Lankan public about the motivations of some countries and international organizations just to win their votes.",

But, COVID-19 has shown us that States are on their own when it comes to the challenge at the end of the day. It is, therefore, important for us to build a homegrown, our own organic policy towards foreign affairs. It makes me to say that Sri Lanka, being a small State, needs a smart foreign policy framework. This smartness should be seen in our security, our economic diplomacy, our culture and in knowledge exchange. Why a small State like Sri Lanka should be a smart State is based on two key factors: one is, structural and long-term and the other is, short-term and conjunctional. The most obvious reason for such a call is the misplaced foreign policies of the previous regime that gave away the sovereignty and the independency of my motherland unconditionally, at times. Such overtly \"satisfying the Western\" policies seriously compromised, insecuritized and infringed on our sovereignty. We have to move away from that framework. - [Interruption.] Let me finish this, Sir. We can debate this later. We have to move forward with a more sophisticated, systematic approach in our foreign policies. - [Interruption.] Yes, I corrected some of the mistakes you made.

During the 29 years, the terrible separatist war did bring influence from ideologies and Western interests to my motherland and to all communities. Yes, we have to learn from our mistakes. But, such learnings necessarily must come up with an organic way of doing things; a homegrown solution is what we are looking at. To deepen our democracy, we should continue to have dialogues with our political aspirations. Therefore, I would invite the Representatives of Tamil nationalism - I will also contribute - to take realities into account and sit down to have our own mechanism, to find a Sri Lankan solution and not to run to Western corners where they have their own interests. And that divide-and-rule policy had been there for the last 200, 300 years played against the global south, as we very clearly know.",

All the Resident Ambassadors representing those countries here appealed to His Excellency the President to reconsider the \"cremation only\" policy regarding the COVID -19 victims. That request has so far not been acceded to. A few days ago, the UN Resident Representative also referred to this incident and appealed to reconsider that in the light of the fact that the WHO has very clearly permitted both options of burial and cremation. In this regard, it is very important for me to say this. Continuing with the \"cremation only\" policy has traumatized a section of this nation. That is not simply a denial of their fundamental right to be treated with dignity, but also it goes to endanger communal harmony.

The Hon Minister is someone that I have grown to respect. My late father was extremely respectful of him, he was very fond of him and their relationship goes back a long way. Likewise, the State Minister of Regional Co-operation, the Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya and myself have a common alma mater and our personal relationship also goes back a long way and I sincerely hope that my personal views on the two important individuals who steer this Ministry do not, in any way, colour the duty that I am supposed to discharge in dealing with this Vote.",

Presiding Member, the Annual Action Plan of the Ministry of Foreign for 2020, under \"Duties and Functions\", under item No. 08, states that one of the duties is to make a study of geopolitical tendencies and advise the Government on strategies to be adopted in the management of such tendencies in a manner beneficial to the interest of Sri Lanka. In the similar spirit, I recall the Foreign Secretary in one of the conferences stating somewhat correctly, I would say, that it must be the duty of the Foreign Ministry and the Government to make sure, as Sri Lanka is a geopolitical hotspot and is a strategically important country, that Sri Lanka is not made a political football where great powers compete and ultimately Sri Lanka stands to lose. I am paraphrasing. Those were not the exact words, but that is certainly the spirit in which he made those comments. That actually is how Sri Lankas Foreign Policy ought to have played out. The fact that Sri Lanka is geopolitically a very important country is not rocket science and it is not a secret. The fact that during World War II, the Allied Forces had their Eastern Naval Command based in Trincomalee in Sri Lanka clearly shows that for decades, if not for time immemorial, that Sri Lanka belongs to the Indian Ocean and its location dictates its importance. But the question is, how has this importance been used? What has the Sri Lankan State done with its Foreign Policy and how has it used it to the advantage of what the Foreign Ministry calls \"Sri Lanka\"? Here is where I think things start deteriorating because it is a tragedy. In my view, it is a",

At that time, it was a Cold War situation where India, although non-aligned, nonetheless had very close relationships with the USSR and Sri Lanka chose to tilt heavily towards the United States and what happened thereafter, I think ,we all know. Sri Lanka became destabilized; it became destabilized to the point where India very openly took the side of the Tamil armed struggle and the Tamil struggle for their rights. Ultimately, it came to a point where Sri Lanka had to sign the Indo-Lanka Accord and a good part of that Accord -its annexures - although the mainstream part of the Accord talks of a solution to the Tamil national question, very clearly show that Sri Lanka ultimately have to, in some way, surrender to Indias strategic interests.",

So, what did Sri Lanka do? Sri Lanka went the other way; Sri Lanka tilted towards China. Sri Lanka had to tilt towards China to such an extent that again, today, Sri Lanka has lost its ability to take decisions on its own. That is the reality. The Hon. Minister and the Hon. State Minister might be compelled to deny that, but that is the reality. You tilted to such an extent to China in order to prevent Tamil rights, your own fellow citizens rights.

You will create enemies and when you create enemies, those enemies will look for leverage. Tamil rights might be denied by you today; you might even colonize the North-East to a point that the Tamil nation might become a non-entity - that is called genocide, by other means - but one thing is for sure, that the geopolitical contestations that you are playing with today will also make sure that you get destroyed. Mark my words, it will make sure that you get destroyed. The day you begin to shed communalism and racism, the day you begin to recognize that the Tamils are as much owners of this land in the North-East as you are in the rest of the country, the day you begin to cooperate is the day that you play this geopolitical game in a proper way where all of us can benefit and it does not, in fact, become a zero-sum game. Even though we might be willing to cooperate with you, for as long as you refuse to, it is you who will also be defeated ultimately. Make no mistake.

However, in the future, I would suggest that we do some amendments to the Prevention of Terrorism Act and I would be glad to help. We have about 14 amendments which we made at our Committee to the original Bill that came from the Cabinet. I would suggest that we amend the Prevention of Terrorism Act as well.",
