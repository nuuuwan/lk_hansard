Sir, the informal sector in the up-country has been heavily neglected and we need to focus on that because right now the image that is painted on everyone's mind when up-country is mentioned is just the tea estate workers and the tea estates. But, we need to understand that there is a huge informal sector in the up-country that needs to be given an equal level of importance.

That being said, I would like to say that His Excellency the President's Policy Statement has given us a new ray of hope. During the elections, the President came to the up-country. When he came there, we were very surprised to see him talk to the people and find out the actual problems.

-

[12.38 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am happy that I got this chance to speak when you are presiding. Let me congratulate you on your elevation to this honoured post.

I am indeed privileged to take part in this Debate with regard to the Policy Statement of His Excellency the President.

I must say I carry no "- isms" that condition nor motivate me. I have no prejudices against the President on party lines nor on racial lines. My sole purpose in participating in this discussion is to investigate the effect the Policy Statement might have on the people of the North and the East. I would find no difficulty in praising the President for the good statements of policy enunciated in the Policy Statement nor do I seek to point out adversely comments relating to prejudicial statements of policy enunciated in that.

The most glaring aspect of the Policy Statement is that it puts forward a centralized perspective of a Government of the Sinhala Buddhists, by the Sinhala Buddhists, for the Sinhala Buddhists. There is no reference to the decades-old problems of the Tamil-speaking denizens of the North and the East. The North and the East, while being part of Sri Lanka, is majority Tamil-speaking. It would have been ideal if His Excellency the President would have had a holistic attitude towards the Island, keeping in mind the necessity to view the problems of the

121 122

periphery from the standpoint of subsidiarity. Sadly, this is a glaring shortcoming in his Excellency the Presidents Policy Statement.

Nevertheless, let me refer to some of the salient features of the Policy Statement which we agree with since they form the substratum of the policies of the Tamizh Makkal Thesiya Kootani, which I represent today. Let me refer to them. Firstly, the Statement says the prime responsibility of the peoples Representatives is to serve the public. I am glad that His Excellency considers our positions as responsibilities and not privileges. That is our view too. Secondly, we are in total agreement with him in saying our duty and responsibility is not to distribute job opportunities but to generate them. Generation of job opportunities is the need of the hour. Thirdly, we agree that our basic aim should be to strengthen the local economy and to increase the export income.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Sir, I thought I had ten minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Your allocated time is five minutes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Right.

Then, we agree that we should assist local entrepreneurs to use modern technology for value addition. We also agree that the production of toxin-free food and ensuring total organic farming in Sri Lanka is an urgent necessity. Then, modernization of fishery harbours to provide facilities for multi-day fishing boats that fish in deep sea is to be welcomed. New technology to develop inland fresh water fisheries industry is also to be welcomed. We also welcome State Ministers being given monetary provisions required to implement development projects. This, in effect, is a principle of subsidiarity. Furthermore, we fully agree with the steps to be taken to completely eradicate waste and corruption in all Ministries and institutions. Finally, we agree that Members of Parliament must visit their constituencies to understand peoples issues and find solution to them.

Then, let me come to our reservations. His Excellency the President says that he will not violate the trust placed

on him by the voters. That is an admirable sentiment, but while carrying out his responsibilities, he must be aware of the checks and balances placed on him by law and the social expectations. Let me point out an example of a constraining factor. When His Excellency brings an end to the existing Constitution, he must realize that the Thirteenth Amendment therein was inserted under an agreement reached with a sovereign country at that time, representing the interests of an important section of our citizenry. Hence, that country, namely India, must be a party to any attempt to delete the Thirteenth Amendment inserted consequent to an international agreement. So, he cannot put away the Thirteenth Amendment arbitrarily however feeble it may be vis--vis the people of the North and the East.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Wigneswaran, your time is up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Next, His Excellency the President says that he represents the aspirations of the majority. Does that mean that he will take into account the aspirations of the majority of the North and the East, namely the Tamil-speaking areas, in dealing with our matters and affairs? Otherwise, it would amount to an arbitrary hegemony of the majority of the country over the majority of the North and the East.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, your time is up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Please, give me a minute, Sir.

Then, His Excellency the President is interested in securing the lives of our citizenry. That is an admirable sentiment, but any attempt to target minorities to show them as antisocial elements under the cover of security would prove counterproductive. Regarding His Excellency the President's desire to provide employment, we need to consider the necessity to make employment available in local areas in consonance with the needs and aspirations of those local areas. Any attempt to import labour of any sort from outside could be a source of irritation among the local people.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you, Hon. Member. Next, the Hon. Indika Anuruddha Herath.

[12.52 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would like to start by quoting the English version of His Excellency the President's speech. On page 3, he says, I quote:

"It is equally important to precisely interpret the mandate given by the people".

And he goes on to say in that paragraph, I quote:

"We have a clear understanding of the expectations with which the people gave such a powerful mandate to the government. We will leave no room for such expectations to be dashed for any reason."

Sir, whilst His Excellency the President is correct in interpreting that mandate for his Party, it will not be correct for him to say that that mandate extends to the North and the East. In the North and the East, the mandate that was given unanimously - I say "unanimously" with you seated on the Chair as well, Sir - was for Tamil rights to be recognized. "Tamil rights" means that our identity has to be recognized. That Sri Lanka is a plurinational country; that there are two nationalities that exist in this country; that our rights have to be equal and our status has to be equal and along with that status, Constitutional amendments have to be made recognizing the right to self-determination was unanimously expressed in the last elections in the North and the East.

Your good self, after winning and when you thanked the people, made it a point to say in your speeches that you are not opposed to Tamil rights; on the contrary, you are consistent with Tamil rights. But, we cannot wait till Tamil rights are achieved for development to take place and that was your role, to intervene for development. The Hon. Douglas Devananda, the Leader of the EPDP, in his campaign posters spoke of ;

"for the Tamil nation to rise". That was his slogan. So, the fact that we are a nation was unanimous in the North and the East. That mandate cannot be violated. That is a mandate that has been consistently given by the Tamil people right through the 72-year history of this country.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) You have only two minutes more.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, there is another issue that I wish to raise. His Excellency the President spoke of sovereignty and that under no circumstances will he allow the sovereignty of the country to be compromised. That is correct. For a President to make that statement might be correct. But what he must also realize is that when it comes to international relations, sovereignty comes with certain baggage. One of the most cornerstone principles on which sovereignty will be compromised is if within the country, the State does not protect its own citizens or even worse, if within the country, the State attacks its own citizens, sovereignty can never be a defence. This country has gone through a war. The whole world says that heinous crimes have been committed and the State is the number one accused party. Without accountability and being prepared to address those issues, you can never -

) ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera - State Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. He says war crimes -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) That is not a point of Order. Please sit. You can speak when your turn comes.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera, what is your point of Order?

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) War crime experts have said that no war crimes had been committed. Sir, he is telling untruth in this House.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That is not a point of Order.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, take that time out of his.

Therefore, under no circumstances can any President or any country, for that matter, try to hide behind the concept of sovereignty to prevent accountability for heinous crimes. The victims of these heinous crimes stand as Tamils; the major victims stand as Tamils and they have consistently said that genocide had been committed and that they want international accountability.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, your time is up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Finally, Sir, there are certain very welcome concepts which His Excellency the President has drawn with regard to development and certain other issues, out of which I would like to flag two. One is with regard to foreign fishermen fishing in Sri Lankan waters and the other is, he has also talked of several landless people and that they have to be given their deeds. I welcome those, but what His Excellency the President must understand is that the North and the East has been a war zone for over 30 years.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) You have to wrap it up fast, Hon. Member.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am finishing, Sir.

The economy of the people in the North and the East is lagging behind 30 years. You cannot treat people in the North and the East equally. You have protect them; you have to allow their economy to grow and it is only thereafter that you can allow -

, . , . , , . . . , , . It should be practical. Always all the Governments, even the Ranil Wickremesinghes Government and the present Government, have been saying we are giving Rs.1000. But, where is that Rs. 1000? Everybody is cheating the plantation workers. But the plantation workers do not ask for a thani Tamil Nadu; they do not ask for a "thani eelam". They are asking only for the infrastructure and an increase in their salary for their work. Everybody must understand that these poor people are the ones who have given our tea that identity of "Ceylon Tea". How did the Ceylon Tea come into being? It is because of these poor workers. They work hard every day and they have been recognized by the world. But, they have not been recognized by our country. So, I stress that that salary of Rs. 1000 per day is essential.

While looking at these statements and while being happy about the way in which he ended his speech, I would like to say that when I look at some of the earlier contents of the speech, I was left with some mixed feelings as to whether he is sincerely meaning what he finally said when he summed up his speech. When we deal with some of the elements contained in the Policy Statement, initially we are left with some perplexion as to whether there was some clarity in what he was attempting to say. He wishes to do away with the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution. He also wishes to introduce a new Constitution. When I listened to some of the Members in the House today, it was not clear whether he means to do away with all the good features of the Nineteenth Amendment or whether he wants to retain some of the good features and do away with those which he feels are obnoxious. Therefore, I would like the Government Members to clarify these issues so that we will have more clarity. I am sure the Cabinet Subcommittee consisting of senior Members of the Cabinet would be able to place a draft very soon so that we can look at the issues more clearly.

Having said that, may I also refer to what the Vice President Nominee of the Democrats who was endorsed two days before, Kamala Harris, the Senator, said. She spoke about Donald Trumps profound failure as a leader. She accused Trump of "turning our tragedies into political weapons". I am beginning to think, are we also turning tragedies into political weapons? I am talking about the Easter Sunday attack and the way in which the mobilization during the last elections took place. Repeated demonization of a community based on a small groups heinous crime is something that we have to avoid, Mr. Speaker. We have seen throughout the campaign total demonization of an entire community for the act of a few. What is important for us to remember is that if a crime has been committed, if terrorism is to be eradicated, deal with those terrorists, deal with those people who assisted the terrorists and bring it to a closure. But, do not go on beating the drum of communal disharmony all the time talking about the fear of terrorism; do not keep the people in eternal fear.

We have endured this for so long. Several of us who stood for democracy, who stood for diversity in the country have been very unfairly accused of assisting terrorism in the country.

Then, you talk about "one country, one law." What does His Excellency the President mean by saying so? Is he, in a sense, trying to go against what he has already said in his Policy Statement? Let me read this: " " Having said that, he also talks about "one country, one law." In a country with diverse communities with their different faith systems, we have over a period of time enacted laws to permit those communities to go on. In their private lives, in their own affairs such as marriage, divorce and such other matters, we have had separate laws which have facilitated their own systems of law to prevail. But unfortunately, there appears to be a perception-

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Okay, Sir.

There appears to be a perception that to permit such diversity in a country which has diverse communities who have enjoyed over a period of time their own systems, those should be done away with for the common good of the entire country. This is totally a lopsided view of imposing uniformity while paying lip service to diversity. This is what we should bear in mind and I hope the intention of the Government will not go towards such a disastrous implication ultimately and we expect that proper justice will prevail. - [Interruption.] No, we are not scaring - [Interruption.]
