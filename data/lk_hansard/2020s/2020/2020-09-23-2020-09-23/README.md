1990 . . . Chapter . .

:

The oral and written representations made to the Commission indicated virtual unanimity that politicisation and perceptions about the abuse of political power are some of the main causes of youth unrest in contemporary Sri Lanka. The Commission is well aware of the important role that politics plays in a democratic society. However, what was underscored during our deliberations was not politics as "the art of governance" but the abuses and excesses of politicisation which give rise to strong perceptions of injustice, especially among the youth.

Constitutional Council

281 282

. .

. . .

Democracy is not an ideal that can be fulfilled immediately. It is a process; it is always a work in progress. We have to take steps which will broaden that process and reach that ideal rather than resorting to interventions with policy or constitutional amendments that restrict the democratic space. I think the Election Commission was one of the main arms of ensuring that democratic culture which prevailed in our society. I do not think that in the current situation, within this capitalist system, we will ever reach that ideal of democracy. But, we must always reach towards that ideal and any measures that are taken to weaken such spaces must be resisted at all cost.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .

. . . . That is the first point.

The second point that I want to raise is this. Please facilitate voting for the almost one million Sri Lankans working overseas. They are the people who are funding our economy with US Dollars 6 billion every year. But, they have no right to vote. The Ministry of Foreign and the State Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion must work together to facilitate the voting rights of the Sri Lankans employed overseas.

Sir, the third point is, there are 83,000 displaced Sri Lankan people in Tamil Nadu. They all are exclusively Tamils. They must also be given the right for remote voting through our Deputy High Commission in Chennai.
