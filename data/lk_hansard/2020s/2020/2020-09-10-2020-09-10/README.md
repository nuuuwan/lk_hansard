Sir, before I start speaking further on the subject under discussion, I would like to bring to the notice of the House that recently a journalist was found dead near the Independence Square and today, we heard from the Hon. Nalin Bandara Jayamaha that Mr. Zacki Jabbar, a well-known journalist of "The Island", has been found dead after three days. We have also heard today that near the Japan Friendship Bridge near the Parliament another body has been found and clearly, the Government needs to look into those because we are concerned about the loss of life.

However, I might say that this Government has been making various criticisms of the previous Government, forgetting the fact that they have been in office for nearly a year in two months, it is going to be one year in office. Just because some Members of Parliament have come here more recently, that does not mean that the Government has not been in office for nearly a year. Under the previous Government, Sri Lanka achieved an improved fiscal position after several years. In 2017 and 2018, we had primary surpluses after 1992. The budget deficit was kept at 5.3 per cent of GDP during this period, the lowest level since 1977, it must be stated. By the end of 2019, it has started to deteriorate. The main reason it has started to deteriorate is because of the Government's irresponsible statements on taxes and the fiscal position in the run-up to the election.

This situation has got progressively worse in 2020. Government revenue has declined by 28 per cent compared to 2019. The Recurrent Expenditure has increased by 10 per cent and the budget deficit has increased by 41 per cent. Development spending, that is Capital Expenditure, has reduced by 44 per cent. And Government debt has increased by Rs. 1,000 billion in just six months, rising from 13,000 billion to over 14,000 billion from January to June in 2020. The fiscal results will get worse as the year progresses. There is an additional cost on the 10 per cent increase in the government staff cadre. The import ban will start to hit government revenue in the second half. Corporate taxes will be sharply down and Sri Lanka should prepare for its worse budget deficit in 35 years. It is fully expected for

expenditure to increase during a health crisis to support health expenditure and to support livelihood. But, this did not happen. The Capital Expenditure has, in fact, come down during this period. The crisis has occurred due to the collapse in government revenue; that is why the crisis has occurred. This is a policy error and the sooner it is admitted and corrected, the government could get on the right track.

Unfortunately, in spite of the reduction in taxes and relief to the public, there has been no benefit felt by the people. The prices of essentials have, in fact, increased despite the reduction and exemption in some taxes. Food price inflation has increased to 12.9 per cent in July. The National Consumer Price Index reached 6.1 per cent in July. These are not our statistics. These are statistics coming out of government departments.

Let us compare the food prices in September, 2019 and in September, 2020: a kilo of brinjals which was Rs. 125 then is Rs. 159 now; snake gourd, which was Rs. 119, is Rs. 144 now and pumpkin, which was Rs. 100, is Rs. 173. These are not prices that Eran Wickremarathne is stating. These have been taken from the Central Bank of Sri Lankas Weekly Economic Indicators, the Pettah retail prices. A kilo of carrot, which was Rs. 114 in September last year, is Rs. 166 now; cabbage, which was Rs. 72, is Rs. 162; beans, which was Rs. 236, is Rs. 245; coconut, which was Rs. 38, is Rs. 66 and dhal, which was Rs. 120, is Rs. 145 now. Those increases are 12 per cent, 21 per cent, 73 per cent, 46 per cent, 125 per cent, 4 per cent, 74 per cent and 21 per cent respectively.

In fact, the Government has reduced some taxes, but after many years, the previous Government was able to rectify a regressive tax system. The direct tax percentage was 25 per cent in 2019 and indirect tax was 75 per cent. When we took responsibility for the Government, the direct taxes were only 12 per cent and we have been able to correct a regressive tax system, taking away or lessening the burden on the poor in this country.

The external sector, Sir, as a result of the poor fiscal management, has also lost its opportunity in the global capital market. We are, therefore, paying our external debts by running down our reserves. By the middle of last year, in June, 2019, Government reserves were US Dollars 8.9 billion. But within one year, in June, 2020, the reserves were US Dollars 6.7 billion.

There are major debt repayments to be made; in 2020, 2021 and 2022, Sri Lanka has to pay mainly on sovereign bonds. Sri Lanka has another US Dollars 4 billion debt maturing in 2020 and 2024. Therefore, I would like to say a word on the debt repayments the country is faced with. Our debt is about 87 per cent of GDP. With the IMF credits and Treasury Guarantees, which the Government is freely giving, it was not 87 per cent, but was really 98 per cent of GDP by April, 2020. It may be higher now. Fifty seven per cent of this is foreign debt, non-concessional, as opposed to only 2.5 per cent 15 years ago. Often, the accusation made about us is, " you were in office for four and a half years. This is what you have done". But, we forget the fact that the Sri Lanka Freedom

1153 1154

[ ]

2020 10

Party and its subsequent Governments formed by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party leadership had been in office for more than 25 years in this country and that it has to take the major responsibility, basically for the fiscal decline and the economic decline.

Most of the non-concessional borrowings - 75 per cent or an amount equivalent to US Dollars 15.3 billion - were international sovereign bonds. China has now displaced Japan as the largest bilateral creditor to Sri Lanka, accounting for 12.4 per cent of government debt. Out of US Dollars 4.4 billion Chinese lending to Sri Lanka, only US Dollars 760 million is classified as official bilateral debt. The rest is considered commercial debt. Is this a debt trap or a "death trap"? is the question that we have to ask.

The external debt in Sri Lanka is predominantly by the public sector and it is very high relative to current account receipts. The pressure will intensify in 2020 when current account receipts will fall sharply amidst the downturn in tourism, exports, remittances and in capital market financing costs as they go up.

The Government has an issue: the State-owned Enterprises. Particularly, they have issued guarantees to the CPC, RDA, National Water Supply and Drainage Board, CEB and the SriLankan Airlines. So, particular attention needs to be paid to that. The CEB, CPC and the SriLankan Airlines are problematic for every government and therefore, we need to restructure the debt. Giving government guarantees is only handling the data, making the Government look good. Eventually, that risk is not a contingent liability. It is a direct liability on Sri Lanka and therefore, the Government needs to look at that.

You have no room because you mishandled the fiscal part at the beginning; you have no fiscal space. You then brought in the Central Bank and wanted the Central Bank to do something on the monetary space. I must say, despite the fact that you forced out two members of the Monetary Board, Dr. Dushni Weerakoon and Mr. Nihal Fonseka, and despite the threat on senior officials in the Central Bank, even today they have done their utmost. It is not a matter of people; it is a matter of policy which you need to correct. So, they have done their utmost; they have provided liquidity, but credit growth in May, June and July has been negative. It cannot be solved only on the monetary side because you have little space on the fiscal side.

In conclusion, if we want an economy that is just, that works for all and not for a few; it is essential that we consider and value womens contribution to the unpaid care economy. It is not only the women, there are some men also who contribute to the unpaid care economy, and this data must be considered. Without an understanding of these factors, what we have is an incomplete or partial picture of our economy. Decisions and policies that are based on incomplete or partial understanding of our economy will necessarily discriminate those who benefit and do not benefit from those decisions.

Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 6 . [..12.19] ( ) (The Hon. Shantha Bandara) , . . , , " " . .

Madam Presiding Member, because of the steps taken to lower the bank interest paid in respect of special deposits to a level of 4 per cent, the facilitation of the flow of funds into the hands of the entrepreneurs became easy. I wish to state that this step taken by the Central Bank is a positive contribution for the prevention of the downfall of the economy at a time when we all are facing a precarious situation.

I do not wish to treat or consider the Central Bank Report as a postmortem; I consider it as a blood report or a medical report. We have to use the indications in such a report for correcting the deficiencies and as a basis for considering the remedial measures that we should take.

We cannot underestimate the role the banking industry has to play in the development activities of our country. Not only State sector banks, but even the domestic private sector banks have to play a significant role in this area. I see the organization of the banking sector towards the objective of being the backbone of the economy as a vital formation in a battlefront. The banking sector has to play a role that goes beyond the supply of financial assistance to other areas such as monitoring and controlling of the activities of the entrepreneurs in a responsible manner. This responsibility falls on the banking sector throughout the world. In this regard, the Central Bank has to play an important role as the bank of the bankers. The main responsibility falls within the Bank Supervision Department of the Central Bank. The Central Bank cannot permit deterioration of standards or any irregularities to take place in the banking sector. Although the regulations are strong, their effectiveness depends on the manner in which the supervision and control takes place. If there is any laxity on the part of the Central Bank, it can lead to a complete breakdown and downfall of the banking industry and thereby reverse the development process of the country. In the recent past, we observed that there were reports about many instances of irregularities and unhealthy operations of banks. We can very clearly remember the disclosures made through the COPE Reports in this august Assembly. It is important to bring to book or punish those who are responsible for such irregularities inasmuch as there is a need to rectify them. These are matters that fall within the purview of the Central Bank. We do not believe that the building up of the economy is a responsibility that falls solely on the Central Bank. It is necessary for all of us to be vigilant and be alert on the developments that are taking place in the region as well as globally.

1211 1212

Madam Presiding Member, having said that, I must air my views on a statement made by a Member of Parliament yesterday. This Member of Parliament from the North always make it a point to wind up his speech on any subject with comments that are contemptuous towards the Sinhalese, Buddhism and the Buddhist monks. We know that he is working on a separatist agenda. It appears that he believes in Goebbels' theory, under which an untruth spoken over and over again becomes the truth. That is why he keeps on telling untruths in this august Assembly. He said that a Buddhist monk came from nowhere and tried to prevent farmers from cultivating, claiming that that area is an archaeological site. Buddhist monks are not vestiges of invaders, but a part of our society and have all the right to protect our Sinhala Buddhist heritage.

I must remind this Assembly that when a Buddhist prelate in the North passed away, the uncivilized, uncultured ones obstructed and tried to prevent traditional honours from being paid to the prelate and the last rites being conducted in the temple premises. These are the people who are talking about discrimination against the Tamils. He also says that the military still occupies valuable lands in the North. We certify that more than 90 per cent of Government lands occupied by the army has already been handed over. What this Member of Parliament is asking for is the aircraft landing path in Palaly.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , ,

()

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) We know that two aircraft were shot down some time back by terrorists hiding in that path. These are grounds of tactical importance and especially, as long as people like this Member of Parliament who promotes separatism is there, it will never be handed over in view of national security as it directly relates to the national economy.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I will take two more minutes from the time allotted to the Hon. M.S. Thowfeek.

, , .

Sir, I am delighted to make my Maiden Speech in this august Assembly at a time our country is, once again, rising from the pandemic suffered by, not only us, but the entire world which has given us a big sigh of relief and more so because the Government headed by His Excellency President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has been able to contain the COVID-19 global pandemic in an exemplary manner and also at the same time, he has initiated a drive to wipe out underworld mafia related to drug trafficking and various organized crimes.

While all the measures taken by the Government in this regard are greatly appreciated, I request, on behalf of the people I represent, to intensify and strengthen further the mechanism to eliminate drug and criminal mafia from this country within the shortest possible time. As we all are aware, lockdown necessitated by the spread of Corona epidemic pushed weaker economy further down to its lowest ebb in the blink of an eye. However, I do not agree with the proposition that all our economic woes are due to Corona outbreak. Economy has remained sluggish since Independence except for a few and occasional time spaces and people of this country had never had a better and a reasonable deal.

Sir, in my view, failure of successive governments to deliver goods is not because we did not generate sufficient income, but due to miserable failure in the

1223 1224

delivery of service by the bureaucracy. Inspired by the need to improve level of service delivery, I suggest the Government to initiate a district-based investment and development programme without further delay.

The Batticaloa District is among the most backward areas of the country. As shown in the Sri Lanka Labour Force Survey 2018, 6.8 per cent of the labour force is unemployed in the Batticaloa District. Only the Mannar District registers a rate worse than Batticaloa; that is, 7.1 per cent. Youth unemployment is higher than the national average. Higher incidence of drug use is reported by the law enforcement authorities. In the Poverty Headcount Index as shown in the Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2016, the Batticaloa District occupies the 23rd slot out of 25. I emphasize that all these issues should be given priority in planning development projects in the District.

Key sectors of the economy in the District are agriculture, fisheries and hospitality industry. During my tenure as the Chief Minister of the Province, we attempted to register a reasonable growth in these sectors, but it was dampened mainly because provincial administration was not given enough financial resources. Sir, I state very clearly that the devolution of political power is not meaningful without providing resources.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, power-sharing mechanism introduced by the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution could not achieve intended objectives because of lack of resources. It is also to be mentioned that there is a misconception that only the Northern and the Eastern Provinces benefit from the power-sharing. Devolution of power gives people of all provinces an opportunity to address development issues involving their localities by themselves. , , , .

Failure of the Provincial Council System to reach the intended destination drives me now to address issues relating to the much-hyped Constitutional amendment. Now, the Bill for the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution has been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers and according to the draft provisions - except a few - almost all the good provisions of the Nineteenth Amendment will be repealed. I strongly state that amendment to the provisions relating to the establishment of independent commissions should follow a comprehensive consultative process.

In the same manner, if electoral reforms are slated, progressive features of the Proportional Representation should be retained. Proportional Representation has given smaller parties a breather for which they had been gasping. Electoral reforms should be introduced only after a due diligence process.

Sir, we all are aware that governing partys strength is the electorate of majority. Minority communities live in this country in peace and harmony since time immemorial. Any move to disturb the equilibrium has always resulted in irreparable damages. The best example I can quote here is the repealing of the Soulbury Constitution when the Republican Constitution was enacted in 1972. Minorities sensed that Constitutional protection given to them under Section 29(2) of the Soulbury Constitution is blown off. But, the architect of the 1972 Constitution was not much impressed with any restriction on legislative powers of Parliament by Section 29(2) of the Soulbury Constitution. Emotional repercussions caused as a result of removal of Constitutional protection can be seen as the seeds of bipolarization between the major and the minor communities. Therefore, I earnestly request architects of the future Constitution to be extremely careful when they touch most sensitive issues.

Hon. Speaker, in the last five years, we experienced a decline in our economy, which had never been seen before. After nine years of continuous economic progress, we had five years, in which there was a complete reversal of that growth momentum. We had a bleak outlook; we had low confidence in the last five years and due to the inconsistent policies between the Governments different aspects, we found that there was poor implementation as well. On top of that, there was an attack by Zahran and thereafter, we had to experience the COVID-19 epidemic as well. So, the conditions were set for the economy to decline further. That is the type of economy we inherited when our President took office in November last year.

Now, we have the aim to revive the economy, to meet the COVID-19 challenge, to reinstil confidence in our economy and to have clear and strong policies which will take Sri Lanka forward in the next few years. We also have to implement those policies quickly with confidence so that people all over the world would realize, Sir, that we are a Government that means business. So, what would guide us?

Sir, we are hoping to have a swap arrangement with regard to the investments that should come into our country through Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds. Through that swap arrangement, we are hoping to attract more and more investments, which will ensure that Sri Lanka will have a stable rupee as well as strong reserves that would allow us to confront any debacle the world can throw at us. As you know, the revival of the global economy is also going to take time, Sir. We have heard the IMF saying that the world will experience a negative growth of about 4.5 per cent this year. So, in that scenario, we have got to break ourselves free and move forward with more investments.

Attracting investments is going to be somewhat challenging, but we are hoping to meet that challenge by providing comfort as well as confidence to the investors from all over the world so that more money will come in. So, those who have thought that Sri Lanka will not be able to attract these kinds of investments will be disappointed because we will attract investments, not only into our Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds, but also through the medium of Foreign Direct Investments. Already, there are many who are talking to us and who are hoping to come to Sri Lanka to make their investments and we are confident that before long, this entire trend will change.

We have seen, Sir, that the stock market has revived. We have seen in the last one month, almost everyday, the turnovers rising above Rs. 1 billion. We have also seen the ASPI increasing and once it is going to be a sustainable situation as we envisage it to be, the investors will return to Sri Lanka. But, in the meantime, we have enough investments within the country as well. Today, the deposits in the banking sector as well as in the non-banking sector in our country are approximately Rs. 10 trillion. Out of that Rs. 10 trillion, if we attract about Rs. 100 billion, which is just 1 per cent of that amount, into

1263 1264

the stock market, that would mean that the capital gains would be enjoyed by Sri Lankans and not by foreigners. As a Government which is always concerned about the Sri Lankan businessmen as well as the Sri Lankan enterprises, we would like them to make that profit before the foreigners could do.

So, Sir, these are the ways in which we would tweak the economy so that it would go forward as well as make sure that the Sri Lankan businesses and enterprises would thrive in the future.

, . . We know that the most important way good governance could be achieved is by ensuring each Minister knows what he has to do and by holding him accountable for the outcomes that he is supposed to deliver. So, we have done that and I believe, in the next few months, we will see the results. Even this morning, His Excellency the President summoned all the State Ministers and gave them instructions as to what he is expecting from them. This is the type of management that even the private sector would be proud of. So, with that kind of management coming into the upper echelons of the Government of Sri Lanka, we could prove to the world that we mean business and I believe in the next few months, we will see how Sri Lanka will progress in its economic activities.

We have already taken steps, Sir, to stimulate the economy. . , . , , . -19 , . . .

. We saw in the last five years the consolidation programme that was in place. We did not see new banks as well as finance companies coming up. We saw so many finance companies crashing. In fact, during the last five years, five finance companies crashed although in the preceding nine years, not a single finance company was allowed to crash and they were all revived during that period. So, we need to install proper systems in our country so that we would be able to make sure that all those would be strengthened as well as would be able to go forward. We were able to do that, Sir, even while the global recession was on. When banks were collapsing all over the world, the Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa was able to make sure that none of those institutions crashed during that year. That was the track

record we had. But, unfortunately, in the last five years, all those practices were reversed and we are today confronted with the difficulties of reviving those institutions once again. We also have to ensure, Sir, that our national development policies as well as all our markets, particularly the equity markets, are supported.
