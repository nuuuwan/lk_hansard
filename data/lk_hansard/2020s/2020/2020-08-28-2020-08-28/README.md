. , . . What is the legislation for the Colombo Port City? Also, what is the investment incentive structure that you are going to offer to people to come and invest? I am raising this because I was the Chair-man of the Steering Committee which looked into the legal aspects and the investment incentive aspect along with a whole lot of government officials including those of the At-torney Generals Office and a lot of private sector individu-als so that we could blend the ideas and create a piece of legislation that would be best suited for that type of invest-ment. , financial city . , financial cities . , financial cities . , , . , . international financial city . , financial cities 100 , .0 . . . Hon. Speak-er, our idea was to look at this as a special economic zone. You can create the legislation for a special economic zone as a service-oriented jurisdiction at the Port City. You can also use a similar or the same legislation for the Hambantota In-dustrial City as a special economic zone for industry. . . It can be financial services; it can be legal services; it can be investment banking services; it can be software services and the like. . , . . roll over limit . , , , .

When we issue ISBs in the open market, we give up our sovereignty and our jurisdiction is New York courts. There-fore, if in case of any inability to repay, they can use that jurisdiction and perhaps, even appoint an administrator, in the worst case. But, if you create a lien on the assets, then the issue of pari passu goes away. , - asset - - mortgage - bondholders . Federal Reserve Bank . ? . . , . . , , . , , .

Once again, Sri Lanka appeared as one of the most successful countries, for which - we have to accept that - we needed money and funding. Expenditure had to be incurred on the orders of His Excellency the President as per the powers vested in him under the Constitution. We have come before the House today to get the Vote on Account approved so that in the next few months, we can move forward before the Budget is presented in November by the Hon. Prime Minis-ter, the Minister of Finance.

The Hon. Wigneswaran must remember that there were people in the past also who tried to undermine the status quo of the Sinhalese. People like Amirthalingam, who was in Parliament, was instigating the Tamil youths to go against the Sinhalese. Finally, he had to face a bullet sent by the same Tamil youths. Also, Prabhakaran thought he can separate the country and develop a differ-ent country within this country. Finally, we saw what happened to him. Unfortunately, the Hon. Wigneswaran cannot be a Prabhakaran because he is too old; he has no time now. So, he had better settle down. Hon. Wigneswa-ran, be happy with what you have and never try to under-estimate or undermine the status quo of the Sinhalese in this country. If you try to do that, finally you will repent and the consequences that you will have to face will be very unpleasant.

[1.54 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam) Okay, Sir.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am glad to get to speak once again whilst you are in the Chair.

I just wish to make a comment with regard to a remark made by Field Marshal Hon. Sarath Fonseka. He men-tioned my name whilst he intervened in this Debate and gave me some advice to be cautious with what I say so that ethnic harmony can be maintained. I wish to point out to Field Marshal Hon. Sarath Fonseka that I am very cau-tious about what I say; I am very measured in what I say. I find it peculiar that he, of all people, can caution me because in his previous incarnation as the Army Com-mander, he made it a point to point out that Sri Lanka is a "Sinhala tree" and that all others are "creepers and crawl-ers" on that Sinhala tree, hardly words that come from a person who is not communal or racist, for that matter. Maybe, he has changed since he lost that post and had been in prison, but I find it very odd that he would have that advice to give me.

Sir, as you know, the North-East is a part of this coun-try that has faced a war and it has been a part of the coun-try that has been deliberately destroyed. For 32 years, we have had a war and in the course of that 32 years when Field Marshal Hon. Sarath Fonseka was General Sarath

Fonseka as the Commander of Jaffna at that time, the areas in the North-East were under a complete economic embargo. A litre of petrol during that embargo cost Rs. 1,500. That was the condition that the North-East had to face. After 32 years of complete destruction, to expect that part of the country to be equated with the rest is just completely unfair. People have been lagging behind eco-nomically for over 32 years and to expect them to com-pete on an equal footing with the rest of Sri Lanka is just not possible. Therefore, it is important - I made this point and could not complete it during the Debate on the Gov-ernments Policy Statement also - and fundamental that the North-East be seen separately, apart from the rest of the country. There has to be special treatment given to that area; peoples economy has to be built up. Without protecting what they have and enhancing that economy, to expect them to compete on an equal footing will actu-ally throw them into a cycle of debt, to a point where they cannot recover and eventually, they will be forced to leave the country. But, this Government as well as the previous Governments, including the Government that existed when His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena was President, did not do that.

One of the communities that have been so badly af-fected by this economic situation are the families of the disappeared because those family members, as you very well know, have lost their breadwinners. Most of the peo-ple who had disappeared were breadwinners. So, those families are in a pathetic situation now. Their situation is so pathetic that for the last four years or more, they have literally been on the roads protesting and on the 30th of August, the International Day of the Disappeared will be observed. It is our view that their struggle must be com-pletely supported. We will do that and we hope that the Government acts on these issues, but unfortunately the fact is that they are not going to. Therefore, the only way the families of the disappeared can seek justice is through an international investigation. Those are issues that we will continue to be strong on because that is the mandate, Sir, that the people have given us.

Sir, there is also one other matter that I wish to raise: the question of political prisoners. Once again, the Tamil political prisoners who are under incarceration are the breadwinners of those families and those families have not been given justice for years. When convicts can be pardoned, to keep these political prisoners who actually do not have any evidence against them without being released, I think, is a crime and it must be addressed.

Thank you.

Schedule of the Constitution states, I quote:

....... I will uphold and defend the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and that I will not, directly or indi-rectly, in or outside Sri Lanka, support, espouse, promote, finance, encourage or advocate the establishment of a separate State within the territory of Sri Lanka.

If that is the case, we should never, by our act and conduct, espouse that kind of a thing. That will only play to the gallery.

Lead-ers need to find out for themselves what is right for the country and lead the citizens to safety, dignity and integ-rity of the nation. That is how we can build this country. There is no point in just going in front of the mob and trying to get votes, whether you are on this side or the other. We have to find out what is right for this country. We must give leadership to this country. That is exactly what His Excellency the President Gotabaya Rajapaksa wants. He made it very clear in his Address to this august Assembly that he wants to create a country where all citi-zens feel safe, secure and dignified. So, I invite everyone, let us join hands, forget about the past, move on and build a Sri Lanka which is inclusive. That is called inclusive nationalism. We do not want any sort of division, we want unity. That is how we can build this country; that is how we can progress and that is how we can make the cake bigger for all of us to eat.

Whereupon THE HON. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Wigneswaran, please commence your speech. [4.35 p.m.]

. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I met a very senior respected Sinhala politician a day or two ago. He made a pertinent observation. He said my speeches were not vituperative nor abusive. He advised, Never lose sight of the need to be objective. I truly value his advice.

Sir, I hate none, but I love truth. I have come to con-clusions about our past after studying certain historical facts. If my conclusions are wrong, others must point out the shortcomings in my conclusions. Instead, getting up-set, abusing me and inviting me for a public debate does not make truth a falsehood or vice versa. If need be, Sir, let a commission be appointed consisting of top Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim and international historians well-versed in South Asian history to report on our heritage and history. The historians must be internationally recognized persons.

I, for my part, would like to tender a note to you to be included in Hansard which speaks of the antiquity of the Tamil language and the Tamil society in Sri Lanka pre-pared by a respected emeritus professor of history, Prof. Pathmanathan. To my Friend, the Hon. Udaya Gam-manpila, I would like to tell that during the past 10 or 15 years, all his historical references have become outdated. Let him study history again and then come back.

An Hon. Member from Colombo named me personal-ly yesterday and referred to certain matters against me. Sir, I may be given a few minutes in addition to my quo-ta, if possible, to reply him. Firstly, he said that I had forbidden Sinhalese and Muslims from entering the North when I was the Chief Minister. Truly, I must be a demon to have said so when both my children have married Sin-halese. Sir, I do not indulge in such vituperative, racial exercises. I would like to see any video or listen to any audio report of such speech, if there be one, to explain to the Hon. Member. But certainly, I may have said that it was wrong to bring outsiders to set them up under the Mahaweli colonization schemes contrary to international law principles which expect the local people to be given priority.

The Hon. Member also asked if I had given blood to patients and went on to say only military members give blood to blood banks in Jaffna. The Hon. Member should realize that the people of the North had given blood to blood banks prior to the army coming to the North as well as afterwards. They are aware that all blood fall within four categories. They do not believe, as some do, that some are born with blue blood.

Then, the Hon. Member asked me naively, What about the Tamils of the other part of the country consti-tuting almost 60 per cent, if federalism is granted to the North and the East? The Hon. Member should remem-ber that we do not ask for separation. Federalism is unity in diversity. Nothing adverse will happen to the Tamils elsewhere unless the Hon. Member sets up his goondas to attack them for no fault of theirs. There were certain oth-er matters that he had referred to, but I have forgotten them. When the occasion arises, I shall deal with them.

I thank most humbly the Hon. Speaker and others in this august Assembly, men and women who stood by democracy and fair play without being drawn into the crude racial vituperative net that a few Parliamentarians were trying to lay. I must also thank the Secretary-General of Parliament for being very professional and forthright in dealing with this same Members outbursts at our training session.

Sir, let me now come to the matter in hand. As a Rep-resentative of the Tamils, I find nothing significant to comment about in this mid-term Vote on Account. No government has so far rendered any significant help to pull out our war-affected people from their penury-stricken, indigent circumstances. They are also not inter-ested in granting economic powers to the periphery to enable them to look after themselves. You would remem-ber that the Chief Ministers Fund was refused to our

871 872

[ .. ]

2020 28

Province during the time of both Governments. Hence, I deem it necessary to stress on this occasion the urgent need to solve the political question of the Tamils first, which is basic to the amelioration of the conditions of our affected people.

We are fortunate that the Prime Minister, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, has obtained a two-thirds majority in this Parliament. He has been showered with a golden op-portunity to usher in a peaceful and prosperous country. By granting what I call "eksathism" as opposed to "ekiyaism", this country could be transformed into a veri-table heaven on earth despite its ten trillion international debt. A form of unionism, which, in fact, is federalism, is the panacea for our national question - unity in diversity. It would be stupid Sir, to run away from problems by say-ing such problems do not exist akin to the ostrich which lowers its head in sand hoping to find a safe haven. Let us face the national question together; let us not hand it over to the next generation. To win a war is easy, but to bring about peace is extremely difficult. But, it is peace that could usher in permanent victory. It is this realization that made King Asoka to embrace Buddhism.

I would like to ask a question, Sir. Why did we fight for independence from the British? We were peaceful and prosperous. In fact, Lee Kuan Yew swore that he would make Singapore another Ceylon. Such was the peace and prosperity of our country under the British. But, we still wanted independence. Why? It was our desire to resurrect our identity by language, heritage and culture that made us want ourselves to be freed from the domination by the British.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, your time is up. Please wind up.

. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C. V. Wigneswaran) Just give me one minute more, Sir.

Many of you, especially those who are in Colombo, would be surprised to hear that the Tamils of the North and the East are now exactly in the same predicament we were in before Independence. Our people live under a Sinhala-Buddhist dominance today. Though we, in Cey-lon, did not have to take up arms to get freedom from the British since Gandhiji in India obtained it for us in an oblique way, our youth had to take up arms to ward off the Sinhala-Buddhist governmental dominance over us. I am acutely aware, more than anyone else, of our political and social limitations in the North and the East. I do not wish to -

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today I rose with hope and happiness to deliver my Maiden Speech in this House. Good sense, common purpose and proper process should prevail in this Parliament. As a first-time Parliamentarian, I believe that we fought at the election with different policies and principles, but with the com-mon cause of serving the people. Thus, as Parliamentari-ans, we should not get carried away by just getting elect-ed to Parliament. My sincere expectation is to serve, across party lines, the people of Sri Lanka at large with dignity and purpose for many more generations to recog-nize our work to this beautiful land. Now, the election is over; a Government has been formed, but it is important to note that this is not the end of the road but the begin-ning of a new life to serve to the people of our mother-land.

Sir, I need to stress that the community I represent is facing many challenges than many other communities in Sri Lanka. Our country is gifted with countless opportu-nities for the future. As per the recent study done by the UNDP, Sri Lanka is destined to have a better, vibrant young population in the coming decades compared to many other countries. So, as Members of the Ninth Par-liament, we should get together, work for the betterment of our youngsters and give them hope and exposure to

growth-oriented facilities. Together, let us make this hap-pen.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes, Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake. ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I just want to make a clarification because my name was mentioned. What I said in my speech was, now you have the oppor-tunity to catch the thieves in the Central Bank that you all have alleged so far. Also, in terms of the electricity crisis, again you all have got a clear mandate - a two-thirds majority in Parliament - to rectify the situation in the country, if things went wrong. That is what I mentioned in my speech. There is an electricity crisis in the country and you all have the opportunity in the next so many years to rectify that. Then, if the last Government did wrong in terms of the Central Bank, again you have an opportunity to rectify that situation also.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I agree with my good Friend. We have submitted a way forward which is known as Saubhagyaye Dekma. We will implement it to the best possibility and to the best expectations of the people; which will give results to all those issues.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Hon. Sampath Athukorala, please. You have four minutes.
