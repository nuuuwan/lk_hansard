[11.13 a.m.] .. : ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for the time given to participate in this Adjournment Debate. What ought to be a constructive discussion in this House has turned out to be levelling of accusations and counter-allegations from both sides and that is regrettable. The issue before us is grave. I do not mean to pun on the word, but it is indeed grave. It needs the attention of all sectors, most importantly, the health sector.

I want to, first of all, record my appreciation for the way in which the health sector of our country has worked dedicatedly for the last several months. That needs to be appreciated in this House and from our side, I wish to record that. But, it is the health sector, particularly the public health sector that has often tried out for laws that can actually deal with this issue. I heard the Hon. State Minister, the Hon. (Prof.) Channa Jayasumana, using the phrase public health emergencies several times in his speech. We do not have a law to deal with public health emergency. We have outdated laws like the Quarantine and Prevention of Diseases Ordinance and Contagious Diseases Ordinance and I mentioned that yesterday. Due to lack of time, Sir, I want to table* a draft that I have submitted as a Private Members Bill which may be cited as the Public Health Emergency Act.

This is something that was presented in the month of March and was made public and we asked the Government to bring in something like this. More than eight months have passed and it has not been done. This is a dire urgency. So much time has passed and I want to commend this to the Government. This need not be adopted, but something in these lines need to be brought in because laws are insufficient to deal with the current crisis.

I will deal with only one example for lack of time, which I mentioned yesterday also. That is, the issue of the quarantine curfew. On the 03rd of May, 2020, I wrote to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka expressing the view that lockdowns and curfews are necessary in certain times like this, but that we do not have sufficient laws to deal with that and what is being done is not lawful. So, on the 03rd of May, I wrote to the Human Rights Commission and I am tabling** that letter also.

On the 08th of June, the Human Rights Commission wrote to the Secretary to the President and sent me a copy of that letter making certain recommendations. In that letter, they have very clearly stated that what is being imposed in the country, calling it curfew is not lawful and that it needs to be regularized. This was on the 08th of June, 2020 and so much time has passed now. The Government has been officially advised under Section 10 of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act and they have analysed all the laws that are extant in the country at present and made certain recommendations. The curfew or whatever that is being imposed now is not lawful. Lawful authorities need to do that. The issue with

regard to the importation of Rapid Antigen Test kits and all of that has arisen because there is no proper law to deal with that. Public health emergency must be governed by a legal regime that is lawful and that can be referred to. And to that extent, I urge the Government, without looking at this as an instance where you can score political points and acting in political expediency, please act in the countrys interests. So far, the Government has mismanaged this. When the first wave of COVID-19 came, the concern of the Government was to quickly have the elections; when the second wave came, the concern of the Government was to somehow have the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution passed and with their eyes on something else, they have mismanaged a very serious issue that the country is facing. Therefore, I would urge the Government to desist from this path and move away.

Finally, this is the month of November in which the world over, people remember fallen heroes who have participated in wars. Our country has also had to unfortunately go through a three-decade war. There are people - mothers, sisters, brothers, fathers and children of many in the North and East - whose dear ones fought the war against the State and had fallen. And it is in the month of November that they remember those dead. I know that the JVP founder, Rohana Wijeweera, is allowed to be commemorated, to be remembered. But, unfortunately, even in the remembrance of the dead, there is discrimination; the Tamil people are discriminated. Our parents are not allowed to remember their dead. I am saying that at this Adjournment Debate because I apprehend authorities using COVID-19 as a ruse to stop people from going to the cemeteries where their loved ones are buried and pay homage as they have done for years in the month of November. Those days will come very soon. And I envisage the police and other authorities rushing to courts asking for orders under Section 106 of the relevant law, which does not apply to a situation like this, but only in situations of public nuisance. This will not be public nuisance; this is not on the roads, but away in a cemetery. So, I am urging the Government to act magnanimously and not use the COVID -19 situation or anything else to prevent legitimate commemoration by parents, family members and others of persons who fought the war and had fallen.

Thank you very much.
