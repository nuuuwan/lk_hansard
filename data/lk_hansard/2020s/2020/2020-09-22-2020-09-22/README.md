The Government has made requests to the international community for a debt moratorium.

The International Monetary Fund has given 80 countries in the world some kind of emergency relief. But, our Government has not been able to obtain even that. So, we would like to have data and answers to these questions. Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Next, the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa. You have five minutes.

Mr. Speaker, we have a challenge in our hands with regard to the External Account. We have already spoken to several investors from all over the world. We continue to engage with them and constantly keep them abreast of the developments that are taking place in our country. We believe that in that quest, within a few more weeks, we would see monies coming back into the Sri Lankan economy in the form of investments as well as Foreign Direct Investment. We have seen the trend, the investments coming into Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds for the first time in seven months. We have seen foreign investors stirring once again. They are keen to come back to Sri Lanka because today, the local investors are making purchases of shares in droves. So, the trend has once again reversed in our favour. Therefore, we believe that within a few more weeks, the financial

systems in our country would move along with the trend, where we would be able to receive new investments so that the country can go from strength to strength in its economic front.

I think the expectations of the Opposition were quite different. They believed that we would not be able to change the earlier trend, but today that is happening and we believe that the message will go across to the foreign investors that time is ripe for them to come back to Sri Lanka. We believe that, in this fashion, the message would be conveyed directly to the foreign investors, inviting them to come back to Sri Lanka to take up position. We heard new investments being announced by the Board of Investment. Just yesterday, the Board of Investment announced that in the first nine months of this year, they had been able to invite investments totalling US Dollars 1.5 billion through agreements signed by them during this COVID era. That, I think, is an excellent start with regard to the new investment drive that we are undertaking.

We also saw, Sir, when we went to see the Port City, that there is excitement. They are very keen to have new investments coming in and we believe that a convention centre would also be opened in the Port City shortly. There would be new buildings coming up and a marina and roads built. So, there is a tremendous amount of interest in Sri Lanka once again. That was something that the previous Government could not portray to the world. And when the new law is brought in to ensure that the activities of the Port City are carried out to international standards, I think the flow of investments would be extremely sound and Sri Lanka would be able to have that progress very soon.
