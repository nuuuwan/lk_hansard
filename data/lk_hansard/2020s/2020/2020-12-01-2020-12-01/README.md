... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) In fact, Hon. Kiriella, we have done that. About 637 people had been granted general amnesty. We have discussed this matter with various stakeholders including the Police, the Attorney-General and the Judicial Service Commission in order to expedite the process of granting bail. There is a problem there. Even after granting bail, they have to be quarantined for 14 days. Now, we are looking at the possibility of, rather than quarantining them in those places, sending them straightaway to their homes for home quarantine. So, several measures have been taken, but I do not want to respond just ad hocly. We will give you a detailed answer one of these days. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , 50 .

I am thankful to you for raising it. We took up that matter also. Whoever who cannot furnish bail could be released on their own personal surety. We will give about three months' time for them to submit their sureties. So, we will do everything possible to address this matter.

Thank you very much for your concerns. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) - 2021, . , 2021 , 2021 APPROPRIATION BILL, 2021 .- [: 30 ] [ .]

Hon. Minister, since I was also fortunate to serve as the Minister of Higher Education towards the tail end of the previous regime, I would like to point out a few matters, particularly some matters that have already been spoken about in this House earlier by previous speakers.

On the issue of appointing Vice Chancellors, though it may be a little uncomfortable for the Minister to meet this argument, I must say, though this may look as if it was in keeping with the provisions in the Universities Act to appoint Vice Chancellors, that it is a carefully camouflaged attempt to politicize the appointment of Vice Chancellors. I am very reluctant to say this because while giving the appearance of involving the University Council in the selection of the Vice Chancellor, the fact is that they are creating two overlapping evaluations. There is an evaluation by a committee appointed by the UGC and thereafter that Committee sits with the University Council once again on the very same day and then they have to select the Vice Chancellor. This process of giving a separate marking sheet and trying to involve this new method is definitely an attempt to camouflage politicization of appointment of Vice Chancellors. So, that is the humble opinion of us in the Opposition and therefore, this matter needs to be given some attention to see that this politicization is stopped. Though the Government might not agree with our contention, I would have to reluctantly say this.

Having said that, another important component of the Ministry of Higher Education is the Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technical Education called SLIATE. This institution, I must say, has grown exponentially since its inception and it is fulfilling an important lacuna and a task that needs to be attended to. Technical higher education is yet to be properly streamlined with almost every conceivable Ministry having an institution awarding degrees or diploma certificates. As for the SLIATE, we must admit that it is receiving stepmotherly treatment from the Ministry as it is lacking proper supervision.

Moreover, it is also lacking proper infrastructure resulting in overcrowding in lecture rooms and inadequately staffed regional centres. So, that has also been observed.

Another important issue is that the lecturers are woefully underpaid. That is an issue of the SLIATE lecturers. They had met me several times. Most lecturers joined it perhaps to get the necessary exposure and experience to get into a university as a lecturer. Due to the poor salary structure, naturally it cannot attract quality academic staff. That is an issue, Hon. Minister, which has to be looked into,. If you look at the student population, you are going to take in almost 31,000 to 32,000 students for the national university system whereas almost the same number is studying in SLIATE centres all over the country. Therefore, it is a popular - [Interruption.] () .. ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) It is 40,000.

1397 1398

( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Yes, it has now grown up to 40,000. Therefore, the issue of infrastructure, lack of buildings and the need to increase the salaries of the lecturers have to be addressed if you are going to attract quality lecturers. Some of the lecturers are even holding classes for about 400 students. It is impossible. There are about 200 to 400 students in one class in many of these centres. So, that issue has to be addressed. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman)Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Sir, I also need to raise two other small matters. One is about the Bill to establish the Quality Assurance and Accreditation Commission for Higher Education. This is a very important aspect that has to be addressed because we have several non-State universities which are springing up all over. You have also made several degree-awarding institutions. There are accredited private colleges which are conducting degree programmes and their accreditation and quality assurance are matters that need urgent supervision. Also you have to have that as an independent Commission separated from the UGC. That Bill is already on your Table and I hope that you would bring it to fruition very soon. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman)Thank you. Next, the Hon. (Dr. ) (Mrs.) Seetha Arambepola. You have 12 minutes.

Before that, the Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam will take the Chair. , . , , . Whereupon THE HON. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON.

, I would like to refer to another matter. - MoU university campus . Higher National Academic Centre in Nuwara Eliya . . city universities . City university university campus . ; Rs. 4,500 million. documents . . .

Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to bring to the attention of this august Assembly and especially the Hon. Minister of Education about the Higher National Academic Centre or the University College Campus in the upcountry initiated by me in collaboration with the Japanese Government through a grant of Japanese Yen 3 billion, which was later estimated to be Rs. 4,500 million. I have all the documents, which I can submit to you.

I initiated this project in April, 2017 as the State Minister of Education. I would like to table* all the relevant documents in this House.

That project was initiated with the persuasion of Ms. Yoko Shimotesuura. Subsequently, the Official Development Assistance or the ODA application was forwarded in August, 2017 for scrutiny and suggestions of Ms. Yoko Shimotesuura before the submission of documents to the Embassy of Japan. On the 20th of July, 2017, my Coordinating Secretary sent an e-mail to Ms. Yoko Shimotesuura with all the details about the meeting I had with Mr. Tissa Hewavitharana, Secretary to the State Ministry of Education and the Director of Tamil Schools regarding the land requirement. This initial committee also agreed upon the University College Project. Then, on 17th of August, 2017, a letter was sent to the Director General of the Department of External Resources signed by Mr. Sunil Hettiarachchi, Secretary to the Ministry of Education for clearance. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . () . ( () . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) V.Radhakrishnan)I will get some more time, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , 3 . () . ( () . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) V.Radhakrishnan) 5 . , I have to submit all these.

In the meantime, I wrote a letter on 29th of August, 2017 to Mr. Roshan Rajadurai, Managing Director of Kelani Valley Plantations requesting the release of 10 acres of land in Talawakelle area, for which I got a positive response through the letter dated 29th September, 2017. Subsequently, I made another request to the Managing Director to release Field number 2, Rath Division at Holyrood Estate in Talawakelle.

On 04th of September, 2017, the Director, Japan and Korea Division of the Department of External Resources wrote to the Director General of the Department of National Planning for review and clearance on behalf of the Director General of the Department of External Resources. In reply to that letter, the Director General of

the Department of National Planning scheduled a meeting on 23rd of January, 2018 at the Department of National Planning. Then, on 20th of September, we received a letter from Ms. Yoko Shimotesuura stating that the documents submitted had been scrutinized and could be submitted to the ODA section as the information, details and the budget submitted were perfect. The cost was as follows: for clearance of the Project site, Rs. 150 million; for construction of buildings, Rs. 2,000 million; for development of infrastructure, Rs. 1,000 million and for the purchase of furniture and equipment, Rs. 1,350 million. Altogether, it was Rs. 4,500 million.

Then, on the 21st of September, 2017, all the relevant documents were sent to the Japanese Embassy addressed to His Excellency the Ambassador, signed by the Secretary to the Ministry of Education. A reminder was also sent on 25th of September, 2017. By 27th of May, 2018, a delegation from Japan was scheduled to visit the site in Sri Lanka and to meet the Hon. Minister along with the other Ministry officials. We were told that the Japanese Embassy was responsible for the arrangement. On 06th of June, 2018, another reminder by the Secretary to the State Ministry of Education was sent to His Excellency the Ambassador.

Sir, I am certain that this project would come through and we would like to have a university college for the deprived plantation community.

So, I kindly request the Hon. Minister of Education to make some positive intervention and to bring this dream a success by restarting it from where I stopped, not thinking about political differences but considering it as a service of immense value to the underprivileged communities in this country.

As I tabled all the documents regarding that, Hon. Minister, please take necessary action accordingly.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . 11 . [.. 3.01] ( ) (The Hon. Buddhika Pathirana) , .

Madam Presiding Member, education, in every sense, is one of the fundamental factors of development. Education raises peoples productivity, creativity and promotes entrepreneurship and technological advances. It also plays a crucial role in securing social and economic progress while improving income distribution. Our spending on education has been about 2.5 per cent of GDP for the last few years. This figure should be much higher in order to achieve a sustainable growth in our society. With Sri Lanka having a much higher literacy rate compared to many other countries in Asia, this should be looked upon as a success, but most of our youngsters and educated people are leaving the country seeking economic benefits, thus contributing for the economic development of the country they seek employment in.

Finally, I would like to say that this Budget fails to achieve the long-term objectives of our education system, which should be addressed immediately and should be the priority of any government. Hon. Minister, once again, I

would like to reiterate that the Nuwara Eliya District is facing many challenges in terms of education. Please, look into those serious issues and especially a university is a long-term expectation of our people. There were so many occasions where promises had been made. During the previous Government, as the Hon. (Dr.) V. Radhakrishnan said, most of the arrangements had been made for a university campus. So, it is up to you to take those measures forward.

The up-country people have immensely contributed to the development of the nation. Education is the priority and the only solution for their future. So, I hope the Hon. Minister would take these into consideration and take immediate steps towards achieving that endeavour.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 13 .
