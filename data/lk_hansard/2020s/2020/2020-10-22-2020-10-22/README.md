( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Next, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. You have 20 minutes.

[12.54 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for the opportunity to speak on this occasion.

A sense of dj vu comes over me as I stand up. Ten years ago, on the 08th of September, 2010 when the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution was moved in this House, I spoke at length and expressed my dismay. But in that same Parliament, in April, 2015, the Nineteenth Amendment was brought in and I remember saying that I did not expect the Eighteenth Amendment to be dismantled by the very Parliament that enacted the Eighteenth Amendment. Now, we seem to have come a full circle and are trying to remove the Nineteenth Amendment effectively to go back to the Eighteenth Amendment, but thanks to the reforms that had taken root and the fact that the Supreme Court, in deliberating these matters, took a particular view, we are not actually going back to what the Eighteenth Amendment was. Nevertheless, I am constrained to register my opposition to the passage of this Bill because this is in the wrong direction.

Sir, this is very important. Earlier in the morning, the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayaka also stated this and I think it is good to repeat. Out of the twenty Amendments that had come to this House to be made to the Constitution, there are just two Amendments that had more than 200 Members voting for it: the Seventeenth Amendment was passed in this House with only one Member abstaining and the Nineteenth Amendment is the other Amendment that was passed in this House with only one Member, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera here voting against it. I should congratulate the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera for a consistent stand at least, although I did not agree with you then and do not agree with you today, but at least you have been consistent. The others cut very sorry figures here today, having raised their hands to propositions that are diametrically opposite, in opposite directions. That is the vicissitudes of politics, they might say, but it is not honourable conduct.

When the Seventeenth Amendment and the Nineteenth Amendment were passed, why was it that the whole House almost approved it? Why did that happen? It did not happen for any other Amendment, but for those two because those had the total approval of our people that this country must remain a democratic country. Democracy, messy as it is, is the way that we have chosen and that is the way, that is the path we will trod. Democracy is messy, we know that; all of us know that.

Discussion, deliberation take time. Sometimes, it is costly even. But, that is democracy; that is peoples rule and that is how you ensure that it is the peoples will that

1647 1648

eventually materializes. I vividly remember the discussions we had outside the Chamber and inside the Chamber during the Nineteenth Amendment Debate and the Committee Stage that went on almost till midnight when the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, the then Minister of Justice, led us through all of those Amendments. So many Amendments were moved from the Opposition, by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris and the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana, he might recall that, all, bar one, got together, agreed and passed that Amendment.

The Hon. Minister of Justice quoted me yesterday, saying that I had conceded that there were problems with the Nineteenth Amendment. Yes, I agree. I have said that and I am able to say it even today. There were snags. But, those were brought about more because of the last minute Committee Stage Amendments that were forced in this House and due to certain changes that the Supreme Court required.

The Nineteenth Amendment was to be the first step in the process of the abolition of the Executive Presidency. It was moved in that direction and this House had every right, indeed the duty to proceed in that direction. Many speakers before me have already said this. From the mid-1990s, there has been a consensus in this country that the Executive Presidency must be abolished. Former President Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga won a mandate of the people in 1994 to abolish the Executive Presidency. The United National Party which introduced the 1978 Constitution, at their Convention in 1996, passed a Resolution to abolish the Executive Presidency. When in August, 2000 President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga brought a Bill for the enactment of a new Constitution, the Executive Presidency was to be abolished. The UNP opposed it. Apparently the stated reason was that the Executive Presidency was not being abolished immediately, that it was being retained for her then tenure of office. That was the reason stated. So, there was absolute consensus, one might say, on that issue. That is also why President Maithreepala Sirisena, when he contested the 2015 Presidential Election, made that his first promise to the country, that I will abolish Executive Presidency. Of course, there was an addendum that said whatever that requires a Referendum will be done after the General Election. So, the Nineteenth Amendment was the first step in cutting down Presidential powers. In doing that, it is true that two centres of power were created and I have said even from that time onward that this can only be a temporary solution until we attain that objective for quarter of a century the country had repeatedly granted a mandate to perform.

At the last Presidential Election, this country did not give President Gotabaya Rajapaksa the mandate to strengthen Executive Presidency or even to retain it; it was never articulated in that way. What was stated was, "The Nineteenth Amendment is a problem and we will get rid of the Nineteenth Amendment". If the Nineteenth

Amendment is a problem, yes, those problems ought to have been identified and those ought to have been corrected. But, you do not have to go in reverse gear; you do not have to travel in the opposite direction to democracy, in the direction of autocracy. That is a wrong thing that is being done in this Amendment. That is why our Leader, the Hon. R. Sampanthan, said yesterday, We always made our decisions on principles and on principle, we are opposed to this. This takes a country in the opposite direction to peoples rule, the democratic rule.

Sir, there are certain fundamental principles in democratic rule that one must observe. Separation of powers is one key element of that. When you say separation of powers, there are three powers and they must have sufficient weightage; it must not be weighted towards one. Already the Executive had all the powers. The Nineteenth Amendment restored some of it to Parliament and a lot of it to the Judiciary. Now, it is being drained back into the slot of the Executive Presidency.

Subsidiarity is another principle. After the General Election in 2015, according to the promise made, this House was converted into a Constitutional Assembly and we deliberated over a period of three and a half years. Maybe, it was a mistake that we took such a long time. But, nevertheless, the exercise was to build consensus and consensus was built by a lot of give and take, and we were subjected to severe criticism from our quarters saying that we had given in a lot. But, in order to achieve a Constitution that all the people of this country can agree with, all had to give in somewhere. So, without compromising on our fundamentals, we did give in and we did arrive at a consensus with regard to devolution of power. With regard to the abolition of the Executive Presidency and the Parliamentary Election system, there were issues. But, with regard to the principles of devolution of power, there was consensus. Even the UPFA Representatives in the Steering Committee and all the Subcommittees agreed to that. While I speak, the Hon. Prasanna Ranatunga enters the Chamber. He was part of the Steering Committee. He was a Member of an Ad hoc Committee that was appointed, which was chaired by the Hon. Susil Premajayantha with regard to the relationship between Parliament and Provincial Councils. They gave a good report. All of those were taken in together and a new draft Constitution was presented to this House on the 16th of January, 2019. That is the direction in which we must proceed. His Excellency the President, when addressing Parliament on the 03rd of January this year, stated that this country needs a new Constitution and he identified four matters - due to lack of time, I am not repeating all of those - three of which are the same as what we did when we sat together as a Steering Committee in drafting a new Constitution. So, that is the task before us; that is the direction in which we must proceed.

This country has had many problems, but none as serious as the Tamil national problem. The country did not go to war for decades over any other problem. Now, that problem ought to be resolved by means of an agreed Constitution. All of us, I think, will agree with that proposition, that it must be a Constitution that all the

1649 1650

[ .. ]

2020 22

people must agree to. Somebody said, Constitution is a supreme law. Yes, it is the supreme law of the country, but it is more than a law. A Constitution is a contract. It is a social contract; it is a compact by which all the people of this country agreed to live together. That is the terms on which we agreed to live as one country. If there is no such consensus, if there is no such compact, then there is nothing to hold the country together. When speakers on the Government side say, " , all of us agreed to the oneness. We agreed to live as one country. There is no question about that. We have stated that repeatedly. But, it cannot be on the terms of one of the communities. The majority you may be and the fact that you are the majority in numbers will always have an impact; you will always have your say. But, the agreement to live together as one country cannot be dictated to by just one community. It must be agreed to and we are ready to agree with you. We are ready to give that agreement, but it must be agreed to on some basic principles and those principles were agreed to.

I ask how can those who voted for the Nineteenth Amendment now vote for this Bill before you? Now that you are on the Government side, perhaps, you have the whip. But, I am asking the Hon. Members in the Opposition ranks - there are many rumoured to be crossing over and voting - why do you want to do that? You do not have a mandate from the people who voted for you to do that. What are you doing that for? What is the consideration on which you are contemplating this act of betrayal of the people who voted for you? Do not do this. Sir, when I spoke on the Eighteenth Amendment, I was a little harsh with the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. I remember asking the question why they were committing this grave sin, that too in the holy month of Ramadan then, on 02nd September, 2010. I am forced to ask that question from that same political party Members today. Their leader came to the Supreme Court and very clearly stated that he was opposing this as an atonement for the sin that they committed during the Eighteenth Amendment. He did not use the word sin for what they did, but he used the word atonement. Atonement is for sin. Once you have come to realization, once you have said that that was wrong and you want to change it, do not go back to that. I ask to every single Hon. Member of the Opposition, Stand up straight and defeat this Bill. Then, for generations to come of this country will hold you in good stead, will look up to what you did today.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, there is one matter that I want to mention before I wind up and that is with regard to all that has been said in this House about Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole. Various comments have been made that he went to court. There is a reported Judgment, Karunathilaka and Another Vs. Dayananda Dissanayake. When two Provincial Council Elections were postponed, Waruna Karunathilaka and another went to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court gave a Judgment. In that, they found fault with the then Commissioner of Elections Dayananda Dissanayake for not coming to court. They passed strictures on him. They said, If he had a doubt, he should have come to court." So, what is it that Prof. Hoole is being blamed for?

That 52-day affair was totally an illegal act by the then President in dissolving Parliament. I am not saying it; seven Judges of this countrys Supreme Court have said it. There was no question whatever that it was blatantly an illegal act, and the President says, Hold an election.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, your time is up. Please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) So, as a member of the Commission, Prof. Hoole went to the Supreme Court to say, The Constitution says this, but the President has done something else. What do we do? He was duty-bound to go to Court on that occasion. He was duty-bound because the Supreme Court, on a previous occasion, has found fault with a Commissioner of Elections for not coming to court and that has been made the subject of ridicule of Prof. Hoole and I think I must put the record straight.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Next, the Hon. A.L.M. Athaullah. You have 12 minutes.

[1.55 p.m.]

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am glad that I am following the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana, progressive at heart although he happens to be seated on the wrong side when this Bill is being debated.

I do not intend to go into the details of the Bill, Sir. I think many Hon. Members on this side of the House have critiqued the Bill sufficiently to show its lack of democracy and tightening of the hold of the State in the hands of an individual. But, you certainly have to ask yourself why the country is facing this situation.

1663 1664

Particularly since 1994, after over a decade of the 1978 Constitution, there has been a cry from the Hon. Members of both sides of this House, whichever party that was in power, realizing that the Executive Presidency was authoritarian in character, that the Executive Presidency must be demolished, repealed and a democratization process must commence. But that process is being reversed today and one must ask why that is happening. I am not surprised, my party is not surprised, Sir, and it is that point that I wish to make in my contribution today.

I wish to draw the attention of this House to the fact that there is a process of transformation of the State that is taking place and what is happening today here is, in fact, consistent with the direction of that transformation. I disagree with my Friend, the Hon. Sumanthiran. My argument is that since 1994 till now, what was happening was an anomaly; the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution and the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution were anomalies. Those were trying to reverse the direction in which the State has been travelling for the last 72 years.

So, with that point, I wish to draw your attention to the Soulbury Constitution, which is the first Constitution that this country had since the British departed. As you know, the Soulbury Constitution came in the backdrop of the pan-Sinhala Board of Ministers being appointed in January, 1936 and at that time, the Tamil politicians rose up against that move. They saw it very clearly as a nationalistic Sinhala hegemonic move to usurp State powers to one community, especially a community that is 75 per cent in population. And in the debate that happened thereafter, particularly when the Soulbury Commission was sitting, eventually the Soulbury Commission came up with a Constitution that can be described as a moderately conservative form of liberal democracy based on the British system of government and what was foremost in the mind of the Soulbury Commission at that time was to make sure that ethnic harmony was, in some way, adhered to. They wanted to encourage a national consciousness and create a Constitution that would meet the requirements of a plural society; that was the aim. It was Article 29 (2) which prohibited Parliament from conferring upon any community-

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Will an Honourable Member propose the Hon. (Mrs.) Rohini Kumari Wijerathna to the Chair?

() ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Bandula Gunawardana - Minister of Trade) Sir, I propose that the Hon. (Mrs.) Rohini Kumari Wijerathna do now take the Chair.

. . Question put, and agreed to.

.

, , () .

Whereupon THE HON. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. (MRS.) ROHINI KUMARI WIJERATHNA took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please continue.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I thank you, Madam.

So, Article 29(2) attempted to prohibit Parliament from conferring upon any community or religion a benefit that was not conferred on other communities or religions. It formed the cornerstone in creating the space for all the peoples that inhabited the Island to explore the confines of a single State. It was precisely this overriding nature of Article 29(2) which made all actions of the State subservient to it and any act that purported to violate it to be deemed unconstitutional. That created the bedrock, the fundamental agreement between the plurinational inhabitants of this Island to come within that State.

In a Privy Council Judgment, Bribery Commissioner Vs. Ranasinghe in (1964 ) 66 NLR at page 78 - the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris is here and he would know this very well - Lord Pearce says this: Article 29(2) was seen as forming a solemn balance of rights between the citizens of Ceylon, the fundamental conditions on which inte se they accepted the Constitution and these are therefore unalterable under the Constitution. So, that was the bedrock on which Sri Lanka got Independence and it was that Article 29(2), Madam Presiding Member, that the other non-Sinhala Buddhists - people inhabiting this Island - were asked to repose confidence in remaining within Sri Lanka. There were certain other measures also: the creation of a Second Chamber, the Senate, the Judicial Service Commission which was independent; the Public Service Commission which was independent and Judicial Appeals to the Privy Council. Those are all measures that were created to safeguard the non-Sinhala Buddhists who, at that time, were having severe reservations with regard to the direction the Sri Lankan State would take post Pan-Sinhala Board of Ministers being appointed in 1936. But, it did not take long, Madam Presiding Member. The Ceylon Citizenship Act, No. 18 of 1948 was brought in six months after Independence and thereafter, the Official Languages Act, No. 33 of 1956 was brought in. These events made clear that despite Article 29(2), the Sri Lankan State was transforming and it was transforming in the direction of becoming a Sinhala-Buddhist hegemonic State.

Then, at that stage, precisely because of Judgments like Lord Pearce's - also in the Kodeeswaran case, Article 29 (2) of the Soulbury Constitution was made the

1665 1666

[ .. ]

2020 22

cornerstone and the interpretation given was that that Article 29(2) was the social contract that kept this country united, made other communities to come together and to live within this one country - there was fear. And in 1972 when the first Republican Constitution was enacted, the tragedy was that that very social contract was done away with. The stated reason for the need for a new Constitution was to rid the country of the remaining vestiges of British colonialism. That might be true. In fact, the then Hon. Prime Minister stated that he was very proud that that had taken place, but in practice, the 1972 Constitution merely completed the process of State transformation into a Sinhala-Buddhist centralized State. That is the direction Sri Lanka was taking. For the first time, Sri Lanka was explicitly declared as a Unitary State. I already mentioned that Article 29(2) was being removed. The removal of appeals to the Privy Council, the removal of the Second Chamber, these are all consistent with the direction that Sri Lanka was becoming a Sinhala-Buddhist State, but, at the same time, it was centralizing. Sinhala was made the sole Official Language. So, the 1972 Constitution formerly began the process of Sinhala-Buddhist majoritarian hegemony. In other words, the 1972 Constitution removed any pretences of the State being a vehicle that would promote a national civic consciousness that would meet the aspirations of a multinational plural society, and effectively acknowledged it to be one of a Sinhala-Buddhist identity. So, under the 1972 Constitution, Madam, the Sinhala-Buddhists became the custodians of the State.

It is in this backdrop and it is in this direction that the 1978 Constitution, the Second Republican Constitution, was enacted. At that time, Madam Chairperson, the Constitution was premised on the need for rapid economic development that necessitates political stability through the formation of a strong leadership, we were told, where the Executive would be free from the whims and fancies of Parliament and where the Executive would be unafraid to take correct but unpopular decisions. But, in reality, the 1978 Constitution entrenched the Sinhala-Buddhist character of the State by not only asking that two-thirds majority be required to alter it but that you also needed to go to a Referendum. Both the unitary character of the State and Buddhism being given the foremost place were cornerstones of that entrenchment and it is in that backdrop, Madam, that we are debating this Twentieth Amendment.

So, it was after the 1978 Constitution, after the J.R. Jayewardene and Ranasinghe Premadasa era, that there came a consensus amongst both sides of this House, quite apart from the fact that the Tamils and the Non-Sinhala Buddhists were ignored all along in this Debate - we will leave that aside - that the Executive Presidency was a disaster. And that was the small change; there was a moment where the Sinhala nation itself took a step back and began to question the character of the State. It wanted to democratize; it was trying to rebel against authoritarianism and that was that moment of the Seventeenth Amendment and the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

But today, if we are going to reverse that and go back, it is only consistent with the 72-year direction in which this country has been flowing. Madam Presiding Member, I say it with utmost responsibility. It is the way this country has treated the non- Sinhala Buddhists, particularly the Tamil nation, it is the consistent refusal to recognize that Sri Lanka is a plurinational country and that there exist several nations in this country - the Sinhalese, the Tamils, why, even the Muslims - and it is the refusal and the consistent denial of that plurality and the need to centralize that is creating this monster and it is this monster that is today destroying your own democracy. It is that consistent refusal to recognize and to be willing to share this country with others, no matter how numerically small they may be, to being confident to say that this country is big enough for all of us and that severe insecurity which make it quite ordinary for Members to get elected with a two-thirds majority and come and reverse the democratic directions that this country has been taking since 1994.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Yes, I am winding up.

I, therefore, say to the Hon. Members on both sides of this House that this is a mistake, this is a mistake that you all will regret and this is the beginning of a slide that will ultimately lead to not just authoritarianism, but dictatorship. At that time, you will search and you will find that the non-Sinhala Buddhists, particularly the Tamils, stood with the Sinhalese people in refusing to agree to a systematic dismantling of democracy of the Sinhala nation itself and we hope, in that same spirit, that one day, you will begin to change your attitude towards the Tamils and the Muslims and create a plurinational State.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 22 .

What we witness today, Madam Presiding Member, is the slow, solemn sleepwalk of a whole nation in an acquiescent procession, carrying the spiritless body of a defunct democracy to an early grave pre-purchased by 69 lakhs of our people. It is true that Parliament has virtually become servile. After the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution, our servility would be there for everybody to see.

The simple truth is that tyranny crawls in quietly, continuously, unremittingly when the population with all shades of opinion, with all types of beliefs on what is good, bad and ugly gives in to the most primal of all human emotions - fear. Who benefits from fear? It is the poor, the marginalized and the minorities who are the first causalities of fear, Madam Presiding Member. We must learn from history. The German Reichstag passed the now infamous The Enabling Act in 1933 after a General Election. The Enabling Act passed total complete control of the State to the National Socialist Party. In effect, it gave complete and absolute power to one single leader. What happened thereafter is history.

Now, let me be clear. It first happened in 1978. Yes, we promulgated a Constitution with the Executive Presidency. We opened the economy. It also created two abominably brutal insurrections in the South and the North. It opened the path to open defiance of the Supreme Court by the ruling political class. The undermining of the peoples confidence in the democratic order started in 1978. So, let us be clear. The issue that confronts us has a genesis of its own.

The Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution has many flaws. We admit that. They should be addressed. It also contained a commendable aspect. The Nineteenth Amendment removed the notion of an infallible Presidency. That is the only redeeming feature of the Nineteenth Amendment.

It should have paved the way for a new Constitution. The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva was one who wanted this done. That did not happen. It did not happen because we failed to see the essential nature or lan vitals of other presidential aspirants who had a vested interest in retaining the system. Since the introduction of the 1978 Constitution, we have seen the emergence of a sizable constituency that prefers presidentialism to a parliamentary system. The 1978 Constitution is a Faustian pact; like in German folklore, a pact with the devil. President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga

1673 1674

was not constrained by a Constitutional Council. She bypassed the most senior Judge of the Supreme Court, Justice Mark Fernando. The rest is history. Then, Mr. Sarath N. Silva came to be appointed as the Chief Justice. As I said, the 1978 Constitution is a Faustian compact. That is what happened to the daughter of the two great liberal democratic Prime Ministers of independent Sri Lanka. In 1994, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and the incumbent Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa could have embarked on drafting a new Constitution during their terms of office. But, it did not happen. Why? Oscar Wilde provides the answer: The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself. So, Oscar Wilde did say he can resist anything but temptation. That is what happened to the former Presidents.

In this light, that the President should be vested with more authority to deliver on his vision of prosperity is mere rhetoric to justify the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution. The Nineteenth Amendment is disparaged because it created two power centres, all of us know that, from two different parties. That is even worse. There is indeed some truth to it. That was mainly because it had the fatal flaw of allowing the then President to retain some powers. The Prime Minister and the President belonged to two different parties and there was a startling ideological and cultural mismatch. And that is being played out before the Presidential Commission now, at a different battle field. We are very sorry to see what is happening to our national leaders, pitted against each other, accusing each other and it is a very sorry plight, Madam Presiding Member. As I said, the Prime Minister and the President belonged to two different parties and there was a startling ideological and cultural mismatch, and it was a deadly dichotomy that sent the United National Party into oblivion.

Madam Presiding Member, that is not the case today. I plead with His Excellency the President and say to him, "You have all the powers you need plus the goodwill of most of the population".

In 2015, I spoke in Parliament wherein I expressed my remorse in supporting the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution. When I appeared before the Supreme Court in person when the case of Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution Bill was taken up, I mentioned this: the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution did not enhance the powers of the Presidency. It only served to contaminate it. Nepotism and cronyism made a pervasive presence and xenophobia was unleashed against minorities. I, therefore, argued for the restoration of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution and to restrain and not remove certain discretional authority vested in the President. We saw the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution as an interim measure with our final objective being the fashioning of a new Constitution where we could finally resolve the conundrum of being trapped in a kind of lost land between a Westminster type of parliamentarism and a Gaullist type of presidentialism.

Madam Presiding Member, we were suitably and substantially guided by the exhortations of the late Most Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thero who sought not constitutional perfection, but the simple ideal of a just and fair society.

I saw the detrimental aspects of the Eighteenth Amendment and I implore the House to learn from the ill effects of the Eighteenth Amendment and also the flaws in the Nineteenth Amendment. By all means, redress the flaws in the Nineteenth Amendment, but do not throw the baby with the bathwater.

In his celebrated tract Republic, Plato makes a piercingly precise observation very relevant to us in this Debate today. He feels, as a rule, tyranny is a natural result of democracy itself. Democracy can produce despots. Democracy provides ample opportunity for would-be despots to make misleading oratory, the effective instrument of mobilizing popular support. The idea is simple. It is the revolt of the common man against the corrupt elite who make up the political class. Populism, we call it. Populism can transform democracy; it disfigures democracy. Populism has been rightly described as an autoimmune disease that eats up the vitals of democracy. It produces a loyal constituency that has no desire or taste for independent Judiciary or any other institutional arrangements for sharing power. They are too much in love with the leader to demand transparency and too much in awe of the leader to demand accountability.

Worldwide democratic pluralism is on a steady retreat. In almost every majoritarian democracy, the minorities are living on the edge amidst deteriorating socio-economic conditions. Majoritarian or populist politics has produced a new kind of political rhetoric that places a premium on name calling, reducing the space and stifling the imagination required to arrive at rational judgements and just processes.

The temptation to jump on the bandwagon to score political points precludes principled politics. The easy way out is to appease the majoritarian sentiments and their primordial instincts. As a minority political party Leader, I feel helpless and distraught to see my community being demonized purposefully. I must thank the Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka for raising some of those issues, pertinent issues regarding this demonization of Muslims and how harmful it is for nation building. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India who warned against communalism of the majority, as reported in the Morning Times on 12th May, 1958, stated, I quote:

The communalism of the minority was dangerous, but it petered out some time or other. But the communalism of the majority is far more dangerous than the communalism of the minority because it wears the garb of nationalism. We have this communalism ingrained in us, and it comes out quickly at the slightest provocation, and even decent people began to behave like barbarians when this communalism is roused in them.

That is what late Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India said about communalism of the majority.

1675 1676

Madam Presiding Member, scapegoating Muslims has become another new normal. Muslims are being ostracized for being different, clannish and being successful in commerce. There are more poor Muslims than rich Muslims. The Muslim community reflects the same socio-economic indicators as the rest of the population, but the Muslims are perceived not only as rich and more prosperous, but also they amassed wealth by dubious means and methods. The anti-Muslim rhetoric used by politicians have become increasingly more and more virulent. What is tragic is that the anti-Muslim rhetoric and racism is now taken for granted; the narrative of hate and contempt is now normalized. The groups affected by this rhetoric are getting mobilized, targeting Muslims. This is happening day in and day out. We have seen of late what is happening. It is like the proverbial case of a genie out of the bottle. This demonization of Muslims is the genie. It may have granted you favours of forming a very formidable Government, but having granted the favours, now it is refusing to get back into the bottle. It is out there to eat you and devour you. That is the dangerous situation today faced by the ruling elite in this country. We have seen examples of this happening. The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne raised the issue of young lawyer Hejaaz Hizbullahs plight. Now, I can see this genie is after him for having raised a very rational, sane issue about a lawyer in custody and the due process that should be applied towards him. This is the plight today.

Before summing up, Madam Presiding Member, may I add that we, the SLMC, have met a few times to consider these Amendments, which have far-reaching consequences to the equilibrium of power between the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. Some Members who are representing the Eastern Province were urging us to consider this Bill and its present contents as sought to be amended positively, hoping that it would be politically pragmatic given the development needs of the area. This is what some of our Members have been talking about to us.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up. Please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Madam, just give me one more minute.

I have taken up the position that several of the provisions are inimical to the concept of separation of powers and as a matter of fact, it would make Parliament too servile to the Executive and almost certainly compromise the independence of the Judiciary.

I will be meeting our Parliamentary group, which consists of five Members, to once again explain my personal stand and urge them to vote based on the principles I have laid out in my deliberations. It is my fervent hope that political expediency for the sake of

compromises should not be doled out as political pragmatism.

[5.35 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to start by saying that we have a concern that the importance of the media in playing its role as a watchdog will be, to some extent, curtailed with the adoption of the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution rather than the Nineteenth Amendment and the reason for that is because the Twentieth Amendment removes the attendant democratic features and structures of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution with particular reference to the independent Commissions. Therefore, we need to make sure that public opinion would always be expressed and that it could be freely expressed.

Sir, since I have very limited time, I would like, with your permission, to table* two documents relating to the importance of free media and some features of the Twentieth Amendment.

Sir, I take great pleasure in speaking today. I think today is a very historic day where a new Amendment to the Constitution has been brought in. I do not know whether it is going to be passed or not, yet. I would like to, very briefly, say a very few things about it because I do not have enough time.

This Parliament has nearly four Hon. Members who are under the age of 30 and most of the Members of Parliament would be voting today on the Amendment. I am not too sure for how long the political careers of the rest of the Hon. Members would span due to their age. Even if we take up the 1978 Constitution, I do not think that most of the Hon. Members who voted for or against it lived, due to their age, to see the repercussions or the adverse reactions of that which may have been brought on the country. Today, as an Hon. Member of Parliament who is due to vote at the age of 30, I would be held responsible by future generations. All Hon. Members of this House who will be voting in favour or against this Amendment would be held responsible by the future generations of this country.

Sir, I do not have enough time to speak on any other topic. But, as a Sri Lankan, as a very young Member of Parliament, I would like to say this. Most of the Members on the Government side who spoke today mentioned that a new Constitution would be brought in and this is only an Amendment to this Constitution. So, I would like to urge all the Hon. Members of this Parliament who are going to vote today to use the same technique. There were so many discussions and we saw on the media today that some parties may vote and some parties may not vote for it. I heard some parties that were opposing it saying at press conferences that they are happy to vote for it today. So, the same way that you have managed to get their consensus for this, also use that method to get their consensus for a new Constitution. , - , . , , , .

( ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed) Hon. Speaker, first of all, let me thank you for giving me this opportunity. Although I asked from the Office of the Leader of the Opposition for time to speak, that was denied. - [Interruption.]

I wish to preface my speech with a word of thanks to my Leader, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, for giving all the Members representing the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress freedom to express their views on the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution Bill. - [Interruption.]

( ) (An Hon. Member) Deal! Deal!! Deal!!! - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed) Forget about it.

What I am going to say in this august Assembly today about the Bill under discussion is one hundred per cent based on what I saw, heard, experienced and witnessed over the period of last four decades. The architects of the 1978 Constitution led by the late Hon. J.R. Jayewardene thought that a strong Executive Presidential system was the answer to the many woes that the country was facing at that time. Proving their predictions, the Executive system delivered very well, achieving a high level of economic growth implementing development projects of unprecedented magnitude with its strong Governments up until 2015. Beginning with the Mahaweli Development Project, many BOI projects started during the late Hon. J.R. Jayewardenes time were continued by the late Hon. Ranasinghe Premadasa and the Hon. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and also many projects like the Expressways and the Port City were started during Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa's tenure ending in January, 2015. We also witnessed the consequences of the Amendment brought to the Constitution in 2015 to limit the powers of the Executive President.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed) National security collapsed to its lowest at that time, as now revealed at the proceeding investigation into the Easter Sunday attacks. - [Interruption.] That is not a problem. - [Interruption.] Provincial Council Elections . [ ] For Easter Sunday attacks, you blamed the entire Muslim community, which is absolutely wrong! - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, please wind up. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed) You all have destroyed the whole economy for the last five years. You could not even hold the Provincial Council Elections, which destroyed the local authority system. - [Interruption.] Within just five years, you destroyed the entire country! The economy has gone down to the bottom level. -[Interruption.] You tried to prove that Muslims in this country are terrorists! What have you done? Then, the President could not work; the Prime Minister could not work; the people of the same party could not work together. It was absurd! So, there must be an Executive system, I strongly believe. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Please, wind up.- [Interruption.] Please wind up, Hon. Naseer Ahamed. - [Interruption.] The next speaker is the Hon. Harin Fernando. [Interruption.]

That is called the "public trust doctrine". Therefore, there is no point in harbouring unfounded suspicion and doubt and holding back the functioning democracy. The Supreme Court says it is surmise and conjecture.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) , . ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Chairman, I raised this issue last morning from the Hon. Minister of Justice. He told an untruth to me. Hon. Minister In this Chamber, I asked you whether you were going to bring in any new Amendments which were not in the original Bill. You told me that you were not going to do that. You did that. I asked this specific question from you. I knew this was going to come. At least you had the duty-[Interruption.] Sir, we all have our respect to the Hon. Minister, but then he should have been truthful yesterday because this is an important matter that concerns the country. There was a duty; there was a duty to inform the Opposition if they were going to bring in this Amendment so that at least we can take this up. If this was included in the original Bill, that would have been a cause for us to further agitate in the Supreme Court when the matters were taken up. So, this being totally out of the Houses attention and being suddenly thrust is a serious violation of the process of this House, Sir.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) Hon. Rauff Hakeem, when you asked yesterday whether I was circulating the Committee Stage Amendments,- [Interruption.] No, I said, "I am not- [Interruption.] Wait! You made an accusation on me. That is not correct. I will tell you one thing. Yesterday, before we commenced the Debate, we provided all these Amendments in which this particular Amendment was also included. [Interruption.] No, I told everything was there. Do not mislead this House and I further told we would consider any new amendment which may come from the House.

But, as a Government, we will not bring anything other than what was there in the set of Amendments submitted to the House yesterday. This was submitted yesterday. I never misled. We do not have reasons to mislead because what we are doing is, for strengthening the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. Do you not like it? I do not understand why because you stand up for the independence of Judiciary. [Interruption.]

1835 1836

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes, Hon. Rauff Hakeem. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Chairman, as a former Minister of Justice, I do agree with the Hon. Minister that the number of judges needs to be increased because there is a shortage of Benches. You cannot form additional Benches because the Supreme Court is constrained and also Court of Appeal is constrained. That is understood, but when the effect of the Twentieth Amendment is going to totally change the composition of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal with the ability of the President to appoint judges solely at his discretion and with the Parliamentary Council being just a rubber stamp, this is going to seriously change the composition and that is going to affect the dispensation of justice in our opinion. You see. Therefore, this matter is a very serious matter. We were kept out. This matter should have been discussed earlier. This has been introduced - [Interruption.] What I am saying is - [Interruption.] This is the very matter which the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena had been taking objection to. Last time also we made this mistake. Our side made a mistake last time. We introduced new amendments, but then that is not to be repeated. That should not be repeated, particularly on an issue as important as this. I think the Prime Minister understands this.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) I beg to differ former Minister. You would have forgotten this. That is, a Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution was brought by you for you to postpone the Provincial Council Elections. The Supreme Court ordered that you cannot do it, that Referendum is needed. What did you do? You all voted; two-thirds voted in favour of it including Hon. Anura Kumara Dissananyake. That is how it was postponed. We are bringing it in, now. I mean, for good purpose that we have suggested this. What we are bringing in- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Order, please! All right. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) I will bring the Determination of the Supreme Court on the Twentieth Amendment to the attention of the Hon. Chairman. The subject matters in the 17th page of the Determination of the Supreme Court are very clear. This particular Supreme Court Determination refers to 26 subjects. One of the subjects is appointment of Judges and acting appointments.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran)

. . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes, the Hon. Sumanthiran. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, while I do not contest the fact that we need more judges, I draw your attention to Standing Order No. 61, where this is expressly prohibited. I just want that on record. The House might rule otherwise. But Standing Order No. 61 expressly prohibits anything that is not connected to the matter that has been placed before Parliament being included as an Amendment during the Committee Stage.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) I respond in this manner. I knew that my learned Friend or my respected Member will raise this. In terms of the Supreme Court Determination consequent to the Hon. Sumathiran and Hon. Rauff Hakeem going to the Supreme Court, one of the subjects which was before the Supreme Court was appointment of judges and acting appointments. So this is not totally out. This is in line with the principles and merits of the Amendment that we suggested unlike including women representation and changing the whole Provincial Council Elections by two-thirds. We are not doing that. This is for the betterment of the country and to address the laws delays. -[Interruption.]
