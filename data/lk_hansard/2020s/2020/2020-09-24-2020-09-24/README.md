I wish to inform this House of my Ruling relating to a Question under Standing Order No: 27 (2) of Parliament received from the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam, Member of Parliament, as the leader of the recognized political party AITC - Ahila Ilankai Thamil Congress.

It has been brought to my notice and also it is self-explanatory in paragraph 3 of the Question intended to be raised by him that it is a matter which is under adjudication by a Court of Law.

Under these circumstances, I wish to inform this House that I am not in a position to allow this matter to be raised by him on the Floor of this House today in terms of the provisions stipulated in Standing Order No. 36 (f) of Parliament.

I also wish to bring to the notice of the House that only one of the leaders of recognized political parties, including the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament will be allowed to raise any Question relating to a matter of urgent public importance as per Standing Order No. 27 (2) of Parliament at the conclusion of Parliamentary Questions on any Sitting Day of Parliament.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayaka)

( - ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena - Minister of Foreign and the Leader of the House of Parliament) . you referred to Standing Order No. 36(f), which very clearly states, I quote:

"A question shall not refer to any matter which is under adjudication by a court of law or to any matter on which a judicial decision is pending; "

Hon. Ponnambalam, I think the Ruling of the Speaker is very clear pertaining to the Question. Normally, a Party Leader gives the Question in advance to the Hon. Speaker before it is allowed to be raised. So, the Hon. Speaker has gone through this Question which is to be raised and given an Order.

The other matter raised by the Hon. Anura Dissanayaka is a different matter - the recognition of a political party which has been elected to Parliament. If it is a recognized political party, the leader has the right, with the approval of the Speaker, to raise a Question under Standing Order No. 27 (2). .

. . . .

( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayaka) .

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . . . . . The Minutes of that Meting will prove that the Leader of the Opposition would have priority. The rest would get the chance only on alternative dates, which has not been agreed on by the Parliamentary Business Committee yet. So, the Hon. Speakers Order is very clear. He is not depriving any leader of a recognized political party of that chance. But, what the Hon. Ponnambalam is raising is a matter that comes under Standing Order No. 36 (f), which all of us have to respect.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Speaker, can I say something and then the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena can reply? Standing Order No. 36 (f) states, I quote:

A question shall not refer to any matter which is under adjudication by a court of law or to any matter on which a judicial decision is pending;

That Standing Order must be read along with Standing Order No. 91 (f), which is the Rule on sub judice. It states, I quote:

No Member shall refer in any motion or debate, to any matter which is under adjudication by a court of law or to any matter on which a judicial decision is pending. The Speaker or the Chair may direct any Member who speaks in violation of the rule against sub judice to resume his seat:

It goes on to state, I quote:

Provided that, the Speaker may allow such reference if he is of the opinion that there is no real and substantial danger or prejudice to the outcome of the judicial proceedings before court.

That is the Rule on sub judice, Sir, that you and the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena referred to. There is no matter that is being adjudicated; there is absolutely no matter that is being adjudicated. That matter has been decided upon. The matter that I have raised or asked from the Hon. Prime Minister is to reconsider this matter. It has nothing to do with a matter that is before court. In the written Notice that I gave you, am I referring to a court matter? So, you are wrong in deciding that, Hon. Speaker. I say it with utmost respect. The Hon Prime Minister is a lawyer; the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena is a lawyer and the Hon. Minster of Justice is also present here.

395 396

( ) (An Hon. Member) The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena is not a lawyer.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sorry. Is he not a lawyer? Well, he is as good as a lawyer.

So, Sir, there is no such matter here. With respect, you have ruled it out not considering the proper Sanding Orders and the facts. I ask you to permit me because in my Notice itself I say that this matter comes to an end on the 26th and it is for that reason that I am raising it. I do not want to go into the substance of it by taking it up. Therefore, I am asking you to reconsider it. You are wrong in making this Ruling. That is number one.

The second matter, Sir, is this. When you got elected, I said this. I said that when you are seated on that Chair, despite the fact that this House is heavily weighted towards one side, you have a duty to respect our mandates as well, however small we may be. Our Party has two Representatives. We have also got a mandate, however small it may be and that mandate means that when I raise something as a Party Leader, when my constituents need something addressed as a matter of public urgency, that must be given the due weight. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition makes a Statement under Standing Order No. 27(2) on a daily basis and he is entitled to do so; so are we. You cannot deny the very fact that Questions under Standing Order No. 27(2) are taken up before the formal Debate of the House commences and that shows that it takes precedence, that it takes precedence over all other matters. And you cannot restrict a Leader of a political party from raising a matter of public importance. Therefore, I ask you to reconsider both those decisions because both these are going to the very core of the credibility and democracy of this House.

The Ruling just announced by the Hon. Speaker states, I quote:

I wish to inform this House that my Ruling relating to a Question under Standing Order 27(2) of the Parliament received from the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam, Member of Parliament as the Leader of recognized political party AITC

The Hon. Speaker has not rejected the recognition of the party, which we also accept. You have been elected to Parliament through a recognized political party. That, we recognize though you are not among the nominees of the Hon. Leader of the Opposition to the Committee on Parliamentary Business. That is another matter which we are ready to discuss with the Hon. Speaker. We are ready to do that. There is no issue on that, Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. Just now, the Hon. Prime Minister also mentioned it.

The Hon. Speakers Ruling also states, I quote:

It has been brought to my notice and also it is self-explanatory in paragraph 3 of the Question - "

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. It is not self-explanatory- ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) "....intended to be raised by him is a matter which is under adjudication by a Court of Law.

So, it is very clear.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. You are misleading the House.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam, what is your point of Order?

399 400

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The Hon. Speaker has given a Ruling after studying what you have presented -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) No, no, Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, please.

Hon. Speaker, you are misleading this House when you say that it is self-explanatory because I have never said that the matter is being adjudicated. My point is that it has been finished. You cannot bring sub judice on a matter that has already been completed. That is number one. The rule on sub judice is actually to prevent influencing a decision that is before court, if it is a trial matter. Okay? This is not a trial matter and it is also not a matter that is being adjudicated. Therefore, you cannot bring it under Standing Order No. 36(f) or for that matter, Standing Order No. 91(f), under the question of sub judice to rule out my Question under Standing Order No. 27(2). If that is the case, Sir, I am saying with utmost responsibility, you are misleading this House in giving a Ruling under those two Standing Orders. If that is the case, I ask you to allow my Question and then let the House decide whether it is sub judice. You cannot - I do not know whether you are a lawyer - make this decision. You are misleading this House and it is the rights of the people who elected us that you are denying.

Your second Ruling that the Hon. Leader of the Opposition has already raised a Question and therefore, nobody else can is also misleading the House. According to the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, another can raise a Question.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, what is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) The Standing Orders apply to pending cases. According to my Friends assertion, it is over.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) It is over! ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) The case is over. -[Interruption.] No, no.

. . . 1002 . . So, let us expand the Committee on Parliamentary Business; Parliamentary Business Committee .

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, we will do it. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, the Hon. Ponnambalams name was not proposed by the Opposition for the Oppositions list of nominees. That is a different issue altogether. We are ready to accept a recognized political party, as the Hon. Speaker has ruled before and as the House has also accepted, as qualifying to raise an issue of public importance under that Standing Order. That is what I said. There had been an agreement before, that out of the leaders of the recongnized political parties, the priority goes to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition; the Hon. Leader of the Opposition gets the priority and the rest has been allocated different dates by agreement, as the Hon. Anura Dissanayaka says.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That question has never been raised. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) That has not been agreed upon up to now. So, it is up to the Party Leaders to discuss it and agree upon. That is the issue. Hon. Speaker, you have ruled out the Question under sub judice. That is the Ruling you have given. So, if the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam still insists that the matter is not sub judice, we can discuss this at the Party Leaders' Meeting as we are meeting tomorrow.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .. . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Speaker, since Standing Order No. 27 (2) takes precedence over the formal proceedings of this Parliament and since my notice was, in fact, under that Standing Order, I am saying with utmost responsibility that you are misleading the House by bringing the rule of sub judice because it is not a matter that can be prevented under sub judice. Therefore, I ask you to suspend the Sitting, call for a Party Leaders' Meeting immediately

403 404

because this is a matter of utmost public importance and then let the Party Leaders decide.

The other point of Order, Sir, is that the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena had the written decision of yours when he stood up the second time. I am the person to whom that written submission should have been sent; I am the person to whom you should have sent it. But, you never sent it. I went to the office of the Secretary-General in the morning and he very casually mentioned to me that it has been ruled out of order. You should have contacted me if you were going to rule that out and you should have sent the Ruling to me. I have been standing here even without the decision until you read it out. What is going on? How can he has the written decision and read it out when I am the person who gave notice of it under Standing Order No. 27(2)? And you have not even submitted it to me. I went to the office of the Secretary-General. At least, he should have submitted it to me. How is it that I have not been given the written Ruling?

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Dinesh wrote it. - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne says that it is the Hon. Leader of the House who wrote it.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Sumanthiran? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir. I am raising two matters. I am a Member of the Committee on Parliamentary Business. There was no decision to restrict Party Leaders from raising Questions of public importance under Standing Order No. 27 (2). In fact, in the last Parliament, although he was the only Member of his Party, the Hon. Douglas Devananda raised Questions every day and there was no restriction on that. So, that cannot be restricted. Under the present Standing Orders, the Hon. Speaker has no discretion to stop that. That is one.

Secondly, with regard to the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalams request to raise his Question under Standing Order No. 27 (2), he has a right to make it. There is nothing sub judice about this. Magistrates all over the country have made prohibitory orders. That case is over. This is not a pending judicial matter; there is no adjudication before any court of law. I am also saying

with responsibility as a Member representing the District of Jaffna that there is nothing before any court that is pending adjudication. So, on those facts, the Hon. Speaker is wrong to rule it out under the sub judice rule. Therefore, the Hon. Ponnambalam is entitled to raise that Question in this House today. And now, I support his proposition that the Sitting be suspended until the Committee on Parliamentary Business meets and comes to a finding on this issue.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) All right. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Speaker, I ask you to allow me to raise the Question. I think there is enough evidence here to suggest that you have misled yourself and this House. So, I ask you to allow me to raise this Question. If you are not prepared to do that, I ask you to suspend the Sitting and convene a Meeting on Committee on Parliamentary Business and take a decision on this.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) In any case, Sir, sub judice rule is not an absolute rule. Even when matters are before court -

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . . . .. . .

. . - [ ]

No, the Hon. Speaker has given a Ruling on the Question you were about to raise. Now, there is no reverse on that. I do not think, Sir, there can be a reverse on that. The only thing we can do is, of course, for the Party Leaders to meet, but with regard to the Ruling given by the Hon. Speaker on this, there cannot be any reverse. If this is going to be argued in that manner, all the speeches, all submissions and all Questions can be reviewed in this manner. So, we stand by the Ruling that you have given, that this cannot be raised today. That is the Ruling given by the Hon. Speaker and let us abide by that.

You cannot just reverse the Speakers Ruling.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . You have the right to make a Ruling, but it must be according to the Standing Orders. The Hon. G.G.

The Speaker in Parliament and the Chair in any Committee shall be responsible for the observance of the rules of order in Parliament and Committee respectively and their decision upon any point of order shall not be open to appeal and shall not be reviewed by Parliament except upon a substantive motion made after notice.

So, you have made a Ruling on it and that is it. If they want to challenge it, the only thing to do is to put it to the

House and take a vote on that. So, let us put it to the House and take a vote on that. Otherwise, you review it at the Party Leaders Meeting. That is all we can do. What else can we do?

Vasudeva Nanayakkara pointed out, if the Ruling is challenged, it is a different matter. But here, we are only making an appeal to you to reverse your decision on your own, voluntarily since you have been advised by your officials that there is a pending case. It is not your fault. The Secretary-General of Parliament has advised you that there is a pending case. But, since you have been wrongly advised and if you are satisfied that the matter is based on a wrong premise, you are well within your rights to reverse it. So, it is not a question of challenging your Ruling, Mr. Speaker.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Member, I agree with you. Now, this matter has been discussed for a long time.

What is the premium that one has to pay for the swap? If it is a market-determined swap, there is a premium that you need to pay for it. That is okay. But, Hon. State Minister, the clarification I want is, whether the Central Bank is going to take that exchange rate risk. If that is the case, then, of course, you open the floodgates, where you can bring any amount of dollars here and then you can actually appreciate the rupee, not the dollar to whatever rate that one wishes to. But, at what cost? Who is going to take the loss?

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) There are zero swaps also.

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) That is what you did. You did a zero column; you did a zero swap.

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) The best swap is the zero swap. My dear Friend, I have come here and explained it to you. If you do not understand it, I cannot help that. But, I am just saying, as you quite rightly mentioned, that this money will come and you are frightened about that. - [Inturrption.] You are frightened that the rupee will appreciate, that this country will get back into the normal position and then there will be growth. I think that will keep you in the Opposition for another long period of time. So, you are very frightened about that. I can understand your plight.

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Hon. State Minister, I am asking a very simple question from you. That is, who is taking the cost of the premium? Are they getting it for free? Are foreigners going to be able to hedge their exchange-rate risk for free or is there going to be a premium that they have to pay? That is my question.

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) Now, I will explain it to you. Please sit down and listen, my dear Friend.

When you give a swap of this nature, the money will come into the country. Are you frightened about that? - [Interruption.] You can answer after I finish. Are you frightened? You have been saying that there is no money coming into this country and during your period, you could not get any money to come into this county - there were no FDIs, there was no money coming into the country through foreign exchange for the Treasury Bills

and Treasury Bonds, and that was an utter disaster. That is why the rupee, in one year, depreciated by Rs. 30. By Rs. 30, the rupee depreciated! Who had to pay that cost?

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Just answer my question, Hon. State Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) I am not here to answer your specific questions. I am going to answer you overall so that you may understand.

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Hon. State Minister, I am asking you a very specific question. Is the Government of Sri Lanka not going to charge a premium from the foreign investor who may invest in Sri Lanka Government Securities? That is the only question I am asking. Is it for free?

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) As far as the Government is concerned, it has issued the Operating Instructions. Please go and read the Operating Instructions, my dear Hon. Member, because if you read them, you will get all the details. That is up to you. - [Interruption.] I am trying to explain this to an educated Assembly.

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) In this august Assembly, the tradition is - just indulge me for a moment please - normally, if the Minister is speaking -

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) So, I have answered you. ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) I am asking you a specific question, Hon. State Minister. You said that you are the teacher and I am the student in this discourse.

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) Yes. ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) I am asking you, if a foreigner brings more than US Dollars 25 million and enters into a hedge agreement with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka or with the

497 498

2020 14

Government Treasury, whether that hedge is going to carry a premium or not. That is my question.

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) On whether the hedge may carry a premium or not, the Operating Instructions are clear. Please go and read that. At the same time, you cannot expect me to answer the question the way you want it answered, Hon. Member. - [Interruption.] Please listen to me, Hon. Member. Do not jump up and down all the time. Please listen to me. You have been doing that all the time. Today, you have had a field day in this House, but I must advise you that it is not so now because there is somebody who could explain things to you. [Interruption.] So, please listen. [Interruption.] Again, you are jumping up and down.

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) I am not jumping up and down. Please explain.

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) Please sit down patiently and I will explain.
