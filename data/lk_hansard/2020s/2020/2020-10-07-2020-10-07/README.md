[2.08 p.m.]

() ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Madam Presiding Member, it is difficult to talk about the subject under discussion today ignoring the situation outside this Chamber, because as we speak, the number of people infected with the Coronavirus from this one factory has gone up to over 1,000. It was also reported in todays newspapers that 64 Sri Lankan migrant workers have died from COVID-19. This number is larger than the number of people who died from it within the country, but those are also citizens of this country.

There is no doubt that this country, as a whole, successfully dealt with the first wave of the virus and yes, we acknowledge the role that the Government played in successfully responding to this virus, but it was not just the Government that was effective here. I think we also

have to acknowledge the role of the health sector and the people of this country who followed the health regulations and obeyed the orders given by the health authorities in managing this situation.

However, what I want to bring into focus today is that while we are discussing these Amendments or changes to our revenue system, we cannot forget the lessons that are being taught by the COVID-19 pandemic. Even as we speak, the sections of the community that are directly affected by the illnesses caused by this virus as well as the consequences of this virus are some of the most marginalized and the most vulnerable groups in our society. So clearly, the virus does not affect us all equally. The consequences of the steps taken to respond to the virus also do not affect us all equally. Not all of us have the luxury of working from home; not all of us have the ability to use private transport to move around and not all of us have the facilities to do our grocery shopping online. Most of the people in this country have had to deal with the consequences of this virus and also of the measures taken, in ways that are very different to that of the few of us.

The issue here is that when we talk about financial regulations and policies, we often talk about the importance of economic growth; we argue across the aisle during which regime we achieved a higher level of economic growth, but the question we often fail to answer is who actually benefits and whose lives have actually improved from the measures that we debate and discuss here. If we really look at the consequences of some of the measures taken or some of the economic decisions that have been reached in this Chamber, we can clearly see that not everyone has benefited equally and in fact, the lives of some communities have deteriorated. We look at the conventional indicators to measure economic success or economic prosperity and if we replace some of those indicators by looking at the well-being and the happiness of people in this country, we have to acknowledge the fact that over the last several decades, the lives of the majority of the people in our country have, in fact, become more insecure, more uncertain and more precarious. So, in that sense, when we talk about these larger indicators or argue about which one of us is most responsible for either the success or the failures, it is unfortunate that we fail to recognize how these specific financial amendments and policies have made the lives of the people indeed more insecure and more anxiety-ridden. I think COVID-19 itself has revealed how different groups in our community are affected differently.

It is not a coincidence that the largest number of infected people by the second wave of COVID-19 happened to be women working in one of the most exploited sectors in this country, whose jobs are extremely precarious and whose lives, during the first cycle of this virus, were also extremely difficult. One employer, one factory or one person cannot be held responsible for this. What this picture reveals to us is that our systems and structures have actually failed and unless we address those systemic failures, we will be continuing to reinforce the vulnerabilities of some of the most marginalized groups in our society.

813 814

2020 07

What we need right now is not just a focus on economic growth, but a focus on our economy considering the well-being of the people from a caring point of view, as to which groups should really benefit from the measures that we take, who are left out and who actually benefits and prospers. So, instead of always focusing on the larger macroeconomic picture and the larger indicators which do not reveal the smaller issues that people face, maybe we need to change the way we talk about the economy by looking at it from a much more caring and well-being-focused perspective.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

[2.57 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Madam Chairperson, today, we are debating the Nation Building Tax (Amendment) Bill, Economic Service Charge (Amendment) Bill, Ports and Airports Development Levy (Amendment) Bill and five Resolutions under the Appropriation Act. Madam, all these Amendments are being sought by the Government with the primary intention of managing the economy in a very difficult situation, no doubt. In that regard, I think the Government must be supported in the background of COVID-19 virus becoming virulent, particularly over the last two days.

When it comes to managing the economy by making decisions with regard to taxes - to increase or reduce taxes - one of the most important indices for that development is health and health is a sector that, under no circumstances, can be compromised, particularly when you consider todays circumstances. So, it is in that respect, Madam, that I wish to flag a very specific issue concerning the Jaffna District.

As you know, the situation in the North, due to the war, has been such that when you look at the number of cancer patients nationally, you would notice that the number in the Northern Province is far greater than the rest because of the exposure to various chemicals out of the war and various other circumstances. So, it is in that respect that I wish to draw the attention of this House to the Tellippalai Base Hospital that belongs to the Health Ministry of the Northern Provincial Council. That hospital had a special Cancer Unit which was built somewhere in the 70s or the 80s. In fact, my family was personally involved in funding that Cancer Unit. We not only built the structure of the Unit, but also funded its Cobalt Unit and eventually, a linear accelerator has been provided to the Tellippalai Base Hospital. Madam, now, this hospital is crucial considering the war situation that prevailed, the high rate of cancer that occurs in the North and is fundamental for the well-being of the people in that area. It is not only the people of the Northern

829 830

2020 07

Province who benefit by that, but even those of the other provinces find it easier to come to the Tellippalai Base Hospital than, maybe, going to Maharagama, Colombo or for that matter, even to Anuradhapura. In those circumstances, there is a very unfortunate situation that is arising, Madam. The Government, in 2018, approved a special cadre for the Cancer Unit of the Tellippalai Base Hospital. Considering the fact that it has a Cobalt Unit and a linear accelerator unlike in other hospitals with Cancer Units coming under the provincial councils, they created a special cadre.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) No, Madam, I have five minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, but it is almost over. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up.

So, that was done in 2018, but despite the Government creating that special cadre for the hospital under the Provincial Council, it has not been filled. Instead, what had happened was that the cadre had been appointed to the Jaffna Teaching Hospital which comes under the Central Ministry and then, those cadres have been sent physically to the Tellippalai Cancer Unit and asked to function there. As a result, what has happened over the years is that there is a conflict between those who come under the Central Government and the provincial administration. There are strikes that are going on. It is the patients who are vulnerable now. Under these very horrible circumstances of the COVID-19, particularly the cancer patients are the most vulnerable. Their treatment has been terribly neglected.

Now, the Central Government is also trying, in the guise of lack of funding and lack of resources, to take out the Cardiac Unit and the Psychiatric Unit of the Tellippalai Base Hospital separately, leaving the Base Hospital to function in the compound under the Provincial Council. Those moves are very heavily opposed by the people, Madam Chairperson. It is completely unrealistic to take only the Cancer Unit and the Psychiatric Unit out of the Base Hospital and bring them under the Centre. Then, there will be an administrative chaos created. Therefore, I ask the Government, considering the COVID-19 situation and the fact that cancer patients are the most vulnerable, to instead make available sufficient funding to the Provincial Council so that it can function properly.

Thank you.

The life of the poor population is becoming harder by the day with the cost of living and inflation on the rise. For the last three consecutive years, inflation has been gradually rising with that being 4.27 per cent in 2018, 4.3 per cent in 2019 and being projected to be 4.67 in 2020. The balance of payment has deteriorated in spite of a narrowing trade deficit in the first seven months of this year.

Consequently, the countrys external reserves declined from US Dollars 7.6 billion at the end of 2019 to only US Dollars 6.5 billion at the end of June this year. This erosion of foreign reserves, in a context of large debt-servicing obligations, has increased the countrys external financial vulnerability to a critical level. Therefore, it is imperative to obtain international assistance in the form of debt relief from international multilateral organizations and creditor nations and concessionary loans from friendly countries. However, even this option is going to be challenging in future with Sri Lanka being recently downgraded by Moodys Investors Service from B2 to Caa1 in its long-term foreign currency ratings. This will have a huge impact on the erosion of the countrys creditworthiness and the ability to mobilize rapid assistance packages from multilateral financing agencies and creditor countries.

The Government has also disregarded the requirement to act in cooperation with the International Monetary Fund, which is the only alternative available to obtain fast economic recovery assistance. Add to that is the recent declaration of the Governments motives of withdrawing from certain international agreements and multilateral institutions, which are making Sri Lankas position very vulnerable in the international stage.

On the other hand, the Governments recent policy measures have also been conflicting and contradictory and therefore, it is sending a wrong signal to the international investor community, which the Government is trying hard to attract.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. Your time is up.

If not, it is going to be a huge problem because this is a virus. This virus may continue for some more years to come. So, we have to be very careful.
