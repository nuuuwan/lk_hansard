( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, may I say something?

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Speaker, the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act ensures freedom of speech in Parliament for each Member. So, you have, in keeping with the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, made an Order. Therefore, if there is any violation of any law in the country, the matter can be taken up as a complaint to a police station and pursued thereafter by Members rather than impinging on the Privileges of this House. I think you are perfectly correct in the decision you took, Sir.

In conclusion, Sir, I would like to say a few words in English. The problem that this Government now faces is a problem it had initially created. It created a problem by messing up the macromanagement of the economy right at the beginning. As the Government came in, based on election promises, it said that it would cut the taxes in the country and I suspect that the tax revenue has gone down by at least Rs. 700 billion. A huge amount. Even a company cannot basically run if its revenue goes down by such a large amount. Naturally, the international ratings of Sri Lanka have also come down. So, my plea to this Government is to focus on macroeconomic management.

We were glad to hear the Hon. Prime Minister say this morning that they are going to depend on international investments. International investments will come in if you have the right macroeconomic policy, if you encourage international investments and if you work within the rule of law. We wish this Government well, but we will execute our responsibility as a responsible Opposition to make sure that the Government acts within the law.

Thank you, Sir, for giving me the time.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, at the inaugural Meeting of the Ninth Parliament, one Party Leader went out of track and mentioned about self-determination and the supremacy of the Tamil language. This august Assembly is not a place to decide whether one language is superior to other language, but we sympathize with him thinking that he is clueless about the true history of our Mother Lanka. . . . , . But, we must be more concerned about his statement about self-determination. Sir, this particular Member of Parliament is asking for self-determination like a small baby going to the supermarket with his mama and asking for a lollipop. supermarket . He is asking for self-determination to fulfil the aspirations of the Tamil people. If self-determination is given to the North to fulfil the aspirations of the Tamils living there, what about the Tamils living in the South? More than 50 per cent of the Tamils in the country are living in the South among the Sinhalese and the Muslims. So, if self-determination is given to the North to fulfil the aspirations of the Tamils living in the North, what about the aspirations of the Tamils living in the South? Does it mean that he is not concerned about the aspirations of the Tamils living in the South or is he fully convinced that their aspirations have already been fulfilled?

Sir, when this particular Member of Parliament was holding a very responsible position in Jaffna, he said that the Sinhalese and the Muslims have no right to live in the Jaffna Peninsula. He went to the Royal College and studied with the Sinhalese; he went to the Law College and studied law with the Sinhalese; he became a Magistrate, a High Court Judge and then a Supreme Court Judge and lived 65 years among the Sinhalese and the Muslims. But, he has the audacity to go to Jaffna and say that the Sinhalese and the Muslims have no right to live in Jaffna.

Sir, this particular Member of Parliament ; ; ; , . , . oaths . , Early this week, retired Supreme Court Justice C.V. Wigneswaran visited the place to take an unofficial oath with his supporters. Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, another Tamil nationalist politician elected to Parliament, also visited the location... .

Sir, I do not want to embarrass these two Hon. Members of Parliament by asking them whether they have donated blood to their own people. Whenever the Blood Bank of the Jaffna Teaching Hospital runs out of blood, it is the Sinhalese soldiers who give blood to the Tamil people. The Vellalars never give blood to the low-caste people because they do not want their blood to be mixed with that of the low-caste. These are the people who talk about the aspirations and the welfare of the Tamil people. They do not have any right to talk about the aspirations of the Tamil people, but it is we, the Sinhalese soldiers and the Sinhalese nation, who have all the right to talk about the Tamil people.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am very much delighted and feel humble to have been invited to deliver my Maiden Speech in Parliament. First of all, I would like to congratulate you on your appointment and look forward to your guidance in Parliament.

The journey to this supreme place has not been an easy one, but was well-intended, dreamt of and determined. It is the trust of my people, regardless of who they are, what caste they belong to, which God they worship, what language they speak, what their social status is, what gender identity they represent, and absolutely their trust that turned a television journalist into a Parliamentarian. It is the people of Digamadulla District that made this journey of mine a reality. Also, it is the unconditional love, courage and support of my mother Katheeja Beevi, my wife Shihnas, family and my friends that provided me strength and showed me the path to this journey into politics.

Sir, this is my Maiden Speech in Parliament. I hope you will indulge me if I take a moment to thank the people of the Ampara District for placing their trust in me and electing me as their Representative. Specially, I would like to thank all the people of Samanthurai, Irakkamam, Navithanveli, Varipathanchenai, Marathamune, Kalmunai, Nintavur, Addalaichenai, Oluvil, Palamunai and Akkaraipattu.

I am deeply honoured to be the first ever Member of Parliament from the All Ceylon Makkal Congress. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the passionate and courageous leader of my party, the Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen, for giving me the opportunity to represent the party from the Digamadulla District. I also want to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to my fellow candidates for their hard work during the election campaign. It is a humble and deeply touching experience for me to receive the support of so many people in my journey to Parliament.

Sir, it is with a sense of responsibility that I stand here today because more than 43 years later, I have been chosen to Parliament by the people of Pottuvil, which is a beautiful town in the east coast of Sri Lanka. My parents, Meeralebbe Safiul Muthunabeen and Meerashahibu Katheeja Beevi, were not from a wealthy background, but they did what they needed to do to provide for their four children. My mother often said, "If you want something badly, you have to work hard to earn it".

Sir, one day during my campaign, an elderly mother from Pottuvil came to me. I had never seen her before. She looked at my face as she could not talk though she wanted to. I was highly overwhelmed. She gave me Rs. 10 as a donation to run my campaign. I wholeheartedly accepted it. She was one of my people. I am here to represent my people. I am proud to say that my entire election campaign was funded by people; yes, one hundred per cent of it was fully funded by people.

I strongly believe that no amount of money can buy a peoples movement. You cannot put a price tag on a

431 432

people's movement that consists of people who are courageous with true enthusiasm and hope to make a difference in their community. A peoples movement is a priceless hope.

Sir, my journey to Parliament was a whirlwind. I found myself faced with a five-week sprint to the finish line. There were many people who believed that it would be impossible to run a successful campaign in such a short period. But, I trusted my people and they have in turn placed their trust on me. I am here to represent their hope, courage and values in this Parliament. It is my political opponent, opponent only in ideology, who made me realize my own strength to be here.

Sir, I have come to this place to serve my electorate, my district and my nation; I have come here to fight for my electorate, my district and my nation and also I am here to win those fights because our democracy embraces as its essence a combative process - a battle of ideas, a contest between challenging ideologies and policy prescriptions. I promise that I will be the voice of all of my people.

Finally, I would like to tell the men and women, young and old, of the Digamadulla District and Sri Lanka that if a boy from Pottuvil who have had a simple beginning and who worked hard to win life can end up in this great Parliament, anything is possible. So, you go for it. I want to see this country become a place where the only limits you have are the limits of your own dreams and ambitions. Do not listen to the people who say that you cannot achieve something because you are not from the right place or from the right school, you are not mature enough or you are in the wrong age. I encourage you to dream big and I commit myself to support you in fulfilling those dreams, whatever they may be.

Sir, we live in a wonderful country and I am a proud Sri Lankan who is privileged and would be humble to represent the people of the Ampara District in this Ninth Parliament. I believe that as Sri Lankans, we should celebrate our democracy. We are privileged to have the opportunity to cast our vote at the nations elections and to take part in our nations debates. Our democracy is made stronger by the participation of more Sri Lankans in political conversations. Therefore, as a Member of Parliament, it will be my priority to engage with as many voters as I could to ensure that the voices of the quiet Sri Lankans in the Ampara District are represented in Parliament.

Let us embrace and encourage our individualism and celebrate our diversity, but at all times, remember our shared humanity. I have always believed that it is honourable to serve my community and my country. I want to be that change I wish to see.

Sir, I would like to speak to the international community as well. In 2009, when you supported the Government of Sri Lanka to finish the war or the freedom struggle, it gave you a promise. The promise was that a new Constitution suitable for all the communities who live in this country would be formulated.

The importance of transitional justice as well should be addressed in Parliament. With the two-thirds majority, I think you can achieve sustainable peace in this country. So, I beg the international community to intervene with this Government. One of the most important aspects of transitional justice in this country is the establishment of the Office on the Missing Persons. But, I do not think that that Office is functioning positively. At the same time, it is important to give reparations to the oppressed.

Finally, I would like to say that it is very important that a new Constitution is drafted for non-recurrence of conflict. With the two-thirds majority, I think you are in the process of bringing in a new Constitution. I beg you to address the issues of the Tamil community in the new Constitution because to have non-recurrence of conflict, it is very important that the Tamil issues are addressed in that. Generally, all sorts of issues are raised to say that the Constitution cannot be amended because there will be minorities who might leave the Government. But, this is a very strong Government. So, I urge you to use this very strong Government to ensure that there is a sustainable solution to the Tamil issues in this country by bringing in a new Constitution.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, your time is up.
