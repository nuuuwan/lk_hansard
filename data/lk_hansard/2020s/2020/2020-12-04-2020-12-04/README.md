( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa - Leader of the Opposition)

Hon. Speaker, prior to raising my Question under Standing Order 27(2), I would like to bring to the notice of the House that there was a news item published in yesterday's "Daily Mirror" newspaper regarding a revelation made by the FactCheck platform.

They had basically alluded to a wrong statistic that had been stated in one of my speeches in Parliament, which was also reported in the "Divaina" newspaper. Having gone through it, I confirm the fact that an error had been made on my part. I want to state in this House that I apologize for my mentioning of the miscalculated figure. Also, I would commend the "Daily Mirror" newspaper and the FactCheck team of Verit Research for examining the facts and the details presented by politicians and policymakers. I applaud their FactCheck platform.

Again, I want to apologize to the House for stating an incorrect statistic in one of my speeches and want to applaud the FactCheck platform and the "Daily Mirror" newspaper for their performance in the media arena, acting as a watchdog in the process of democracy that we have in our country today.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) . [10.43 a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Chairman, at a time when this august Assembly is discussing the Votes of two important Ministries, the Ministry of Industries and the Ministry of Trade, I believe it is imperative and vital that we focus on the national financial issues which have a direct bearing on the industrial policy and also the trade policy of our country.

Sir, if I may, with your permission, revert to the whole economic expos that was presented to this august Assembly by the State Minister of Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms a few days ago in response to a Question I posed under Standing Order 27(2) regarding the downgrading of Sri Lanka by the Fitch Ratings, I would like to say that, as usual, with all his bullishness, the State Minister went on a whole essay on the financial and economic policy of our country. I was restricted in replying to him because of the Standing Orders. So, I take this opportunity when the Votes of the Ministry of Industries and the Ministry of Trade are being discussed to articulate the present situation of our economy. In all bullishness, the State Minister expressed a series of opinions and some have gone on to provide him with accolades that he had provided all of us with a lesson in finance.

Now, let me bring to the notice of this august Assembly the fact that the present administration has failed in its duty to present to the country the second and

third quarters' figures of economic growth. We all know that the Department of Census and Statistics announced that, in the first quarter, we had a negative growth, a minus 1.6 per cent growth. It is incumbent upon the Department of Census and Statistics and the present administration to put out the figures of economic growth after 75 days from the conclusion of that particular quarter. But, this Government or the administration has woefully failed in providing these figures to the country as a whole and to this august Assembly, the Parliament. Since the Government has engaged in hiding these statistics, a negative impression has been created in the financial markets, which does not bode well for our countrys economy. Various international institutions which have a pre-eminent role in managing the world economy have expressed their surprise at this negligent conduct of the present administration. This Government cannot express either to our country or to the International Community the growth rate in the second and third quarters. What are you all hiding? Why are you all running away from exhibiting these statistics?

The second issue I want to raise, Sir, is that this Government, through the Budget Speech, 2021, expounded the fact that the States income is going to achieve a humongous rise from the present state of 9 per cent of GNP to 14 per cent.

I would like to ask the State Minister, when have we in our history achieved such a huge jump in State income within a course of twelve months? This Government is predicting that State income will rise from 9 to 14 per cent of GNP. This is preposterous; this is absolute humbug! This is an attempt to deceive both the Parliament and the people of our country.

Sir, the so-called economic maestro of the present administration, the State Minister of Money and Capital Market, says that the present administration is embarking on a revolutionary, path-breaking economic policy which no other Government has implemented ever in our economic and political history. Well, in a sense, I agree with him because at the end of last year, this Government took the most ludicrous decision of cutting taxes to benefit the rich, the super-rich in our country, thereby ensuring that up to Rs. 600 billion to Rs. 800 billion of Government revenue was given as handouts to the well-off section, to the rich in our society. What was the theory behind it? The entrepreneurial class of our country, the super-rich would invest the savings they would receive through these tax cuts to ensure that speedy economic activities take place in our domestic economy and thereby, propel economic growth in our country. So, if that was the theory of the Government, it is no different to the neoliberal economic theory of trickle-down economics. Through these tax cuts, this Government has crowned themselves as a super neoliberalist in the whole world. Rs. 600 billion to Rs. 800 billion in tax cuts to the super-rich, and the State Minister is trying to claim that he is the economic guru of this present administration.

Sir, this Government has embarked on a policy, as I see it, of some medieval autarky putting import restrictions and having a process whereby we are moving towards a command economic model, a restricted

2007 2008

economic model which stifles international trade and we are somewhat moving towards an economy that is akin to North Korea, a failed State, a failed economy, a bankrupt economy. This administration is striving to disengage themselves from international activity. Kindly focus your attention to the statement of the EU countries. They are alarmed. When the EU countries are alarmed, we, as a responsible Opposition, too, are alarmed because the EU is a vital export destination for Sri Lankan exports. The EU is talking about a one-way street attitude of the Sri Lankan Government.

If the EU countries decide that they would reject the import restriction policy the Sri Lankan Government is embarking upon, has the Government given some thought to the detrimental impact it would bring on Sri Lankan exporters? Has the Government given an iota of attention to the loss of the EU market and how it is going to impact on domestic employment? I think the Government has not.

Sir, the international ratings are an important indicator of gauging international confidence in our economy and how the international society perceives the present status of our economy. That has a direct bearing on investment inflows. Foreign Direct Investment has a direct bearing on businesses that are proposed to be set up in our country. Sir, I would like to point out that when the whole international society is looking at Fitch Ratings, Moody's Ratings, Standard & Poor's and so on and so forth, we are the only country that is rejecting those international ratings. I would like to ask the Hon. Members of the Government, is there a domestic rating system that is going to encourage and induce foreign investors to come to Sri Lanka? Does the Government possess some magic wand which they can exhibit and which would attract foreign investors to come and set up businesses in Sri Lanka and promote employment? , Fitch , Standard & Poor's , Moody's ? ? Come on! It is a ridiculous argument that is proposed by the so-called "economic guru" of the present administration who happens to represent Parliament on the National List.

Also, Sir, in his reply to my Question raised under Standing Order No. 27(2), he was talking of post-COVID as if COVID had dissipated or disappeared from our society. We are going through the second wave of COVID-19 and does the State Minister of Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms not realize that? Is he not in touch with the grassroots of our country? Is he detached from the reality of our country? He is mentioning in this august Assembly that we are in a post-COVID situation. We are not. We are in the midst of the second wave. But, the State Minister has failed even to realize that. So, a person who is in cloud cuckoo land, who is in a dream land comes to this august Assembly to explain the Governments financial and economic policy. Sir, I pity the Government. That is what I have to say. These people are deciding on Government economic

policy while languishing in the clouds, while being in seventh heaven. They do not realize the present situation.

I will tell you, Sir, what the Government is engaging in. It is engaging in what once President Bush spoke of, Reaganomics: they are engaging in voodoo economics; they are engaging in crony capitalism. They are propagating lies, untruths and deception to mislead the people. The present administration is a hostage to super-rich business interests and business, oligarchical interests. So, I want to basically state the fact that the State Minister uses his natural suave to deceive the people of our country, going to the extent of deceiving those who report business within this august Assembly. So, I can tell you, yes, the Hon. Cabraal did give us a lesson, but the lesson was confined to deception, lies and untruths. He gave a super defence of crony capitalism and the oligarchic and hegemonic economic policy this Government is implementing and they are trying to hide behind their ineptness. This Government is totally incompetent.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, I think, during your speech, it is by mistake that you mentioned about the country as a "failed State". So, permit me to expunge that part from your speech because I think that has nothing to do with us.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Chairman, I never mentioned failed State. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes, you did. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) No, I never mentioned that. It is not in my notes.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) No, I did not utter the words failed State. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) If you did not, there is no problem. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) I am insisting. I know my English. Please respect my linguistic skills.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) It is okay. I have no question about that.

2011 2012

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) I never mentioned failed State. Please understand the distinction between the two terms failed State and failed Government. - - .

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) If it had been so stated, we will get it expunged. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) This is ludicrous! I am sorry, I never mentioned the words failed State. You are totally wrong.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes, Hon. Ponnambalam?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Chairman, on what grounds can you expunge the term failed State? There is nothing in the Standing Orders that can make you expunge that term.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) No, it has nothing to do with -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) That is an opinion. For example, if I, in the course of a speech, use the term failed State, you cannot expunge that. That is my opinion. How on earth can you expunge that? What gives you the right to expunge such terms? You cannot. That is entirely an opinion. It is an opinion that can be expressed rightfully and legally to depict what we consider to be the situation. So, you cannot expunge that.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Sir, I do not think we need to waste time of the House on this.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes, we will look into that.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Basically, - [Interruption.] Sorry, what is it? What is the problem? - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) No, it was not supportive. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, I do not need anyones support.

Dayasiri Jayasekara) Sir, it was a very supportive comment from the Hon. Ponnambalam because they wanted to say that Sri Lanka is a failed State. That is what they wanted to say. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. He mentioned my name. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Let me handle it. Sir, I am surprised by the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekaras kindness towards me. I can vouch for the fact that I do not need anybodys support because I have a very strong backbone. I am sure he may need the support of many to ensure that he could serve the people of this country and I am surprised by the utter ignorance that has been displayed by the Hon. Member on the opposite side.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) It is okay. We do not need to go into the details of that.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Are you telling me that ignorance is okay? Hon. Chairman, are you telling me that ignorance is okay?

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) How come the microphone goes off? Hon. Chairman, I want you to have an investigation into this. Even just now the mike went off. Who do you have in the corridors to handle the microphone? Who is handling it? How can they switch it off like this? Are they given special instructions that my speech has to be disturbed?

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) No. Normally when I start speaking - [Interruption.] ( ) (An Hon. Member) It is by your previous leader. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Really? Are you privy to that information? Come on, I am just having a conversation with the Hon. Chairman.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, we do not need to go into details. If it had not been stated, we will forget about it. It is okay.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) I think ignorance should not be tolerated in this House. There are so many who are ignorant.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes, it has to be applied to everybody.

The next speaker is the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa. [.. 11.10]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) , we have already decided to establish two batik training centres in Jaffna, one, in Dharmapuram and another in some other place, the name of which I cannot remember. Next year, definitely we are going to start so many batik training centres in the North and the East. So, we will give you the fullest support. I know there are so many issues with regard to the handloom industry. I will personally visit all these places and try to develop the handloom industry again.

( ) (The Hon. Selvam Adaikkalanathan) Thank you, Hon. State Minister.
