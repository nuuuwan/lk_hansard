That news item states that travellers from Sri Lanka will no longer be required to self-isolate on arrival in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The British High Commission in Colombo said that yesterday in a statement. The British

* . * . * Produced at end of speech.

High Commission said the decisions on exempted countries are informed by a number of factors, including the latest epidemiological assessments. So, it is very important that we realize that what we have been doing is estimated by these countries and they have relaxed the rule on self-isolation, which the Sri Lankans did not enjoy up to now.

. - 1 . . - - . . . . WHO " " . . . . . . . ; . . Never in the history, after the last Depression almost 100 years ago, did this type of situation arise. This is a new situation. We will not have a progress in the world economy or in economies of our countries as we did before COVID-19. The post-COVID-19 situation will be a totally new situation. . . . . ? . .

No. He will support it and we will deliver the Rs. 1,000. It is an assurance given by the President. I know that the late Hon. Arumugan Thondaman and the leaders of the plantation sector had a lot of discussions. We had virtually reached up to a rate of Rs. 950 when the elections came and when he passed away. So, there are possibilities of increasing this wage by way of an increased production or by other means. But, we will deliver it! I want to tell the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, who questioned whether we will deliver it, that we will deliver it because we are thinking out of the box without depending on the lessons that reach us from various universities which are, perhaps, still studying the situations in their own countries.

. () . . . . . . . - [ ] Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, I have no time, please. You have had your time. We can discuss most of these issues outside. I know that you are an intelligent Member. But, I must say that I do not belong to the category of intellectual dishonesty. That, I must say. . . ? . . . . . . .

An EU Delegation met me at the Foreign Ministry. Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition came and read out a notice that appeared. The EU has their own problems and they understand our problems. We discussed. There are areas that are being resolved; there are areas in which they have helped us. They will continue to help us. They gave the assurance, I must say, that they will continue to help us. And on the question of GSP Plus, assurances were given. There are other matters that we are have tried to resolve. I do not represent the automobile industry. I must say that the automobile industry is one area that has been affected. But, do we immediately need automobiles or investments? Concessions have been granted to restart or reinvest in new areas like technology and IT, which will cut down unnecessary expenditures of our country from the Government sector to the private sector. So, the wasteful expenditure will be reduced because of the new investments in the IT sector and in technology, which has been mentioned before.

. ? "" . ? . . " " . . .

. . .

. . . It is a totally different world. Various investments come under bonds and maybe, under different monetary instruments that we can renegotiate and create. Let us put our minds to it.

. .

. ? . . . . .

. In this Budget, climate change has also been recognized. This is an issue that is discussed right across the world. Climate change cannot be ignored. . . . . . The global economic slow down is about 5.2 per cent. on a positive growth for which Parliament must support.

The Gulf countries have had no major problem in economic terms. Hundreds of thousands of expatriates are working there. After every discussion with the Hon. Prime Minister, they have granted assistance for our projects. .

[2.17 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, having observed the Budget Debate for the last three days, I can see a concerted attempt by Government Members to describe this Budget as a growth-focused Budget with emphasis on boosting trade deficit and minimizing the strain on foreign exchange reserves. Then, coupled with the industry-focused interventions contained in the Budget, according to them, this will contribute to boosting growth.

Sir, let me, at the outset, ask this simple question. Is your 6 per cent per annum GDP growth projection for the next five years not a pipe dream? Let me focus on two issues: our growth and debt portfolio and debt sustainability. 2021, in my view, is going to be a very stressful year. COVID-19 has impacted on a majority of businesses of all forms. In my view, GDP growth, in the short term, will recover very slowly. The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal will testify to that. So, an immediate jump to 6 per cent is a very unrealistic forecast.

There are some negative features which are bound to hamper growth in the short term. The tourism industry, which contributes about US Dollars 4 to 5 billion to the economy, is in slumber and my personal view is that that industry will continue to be procrastinating until the second half of 2022. Sir, my view on this may be

questioned, but the basis of my conclusion is, Sri Lanka has been a market for middle and lower middle-income tourists. With the whole world facing the post-COVID economic stress, the spending part of the middle and lower middle-income population globally has diminished. In this backdrop, this segment of the global population venturing out on vacation, in the short term, is very remote and this will surely impact on the Sri Lakan tourist industry.

Furthermore, most of these businesses have been highly leveraged with bank debt and have not been servicing their debts since April, 2019. Based on the Easter Sunday related moratoriums granted by the State, these moratoriums have been further extended into 2021. In this backdrop, with no predictable revenues for the industry until at least mid-2022, in late 2021, debt servicing will become a major challenge to all these businesses. I understand that the total debt to the tourism industry in bank balance sheets is in the region of Rs. 350 billion. This is a very significant number and translates to about 39 per cent of the regulatory capital of all licensed commercial banks in this country. This chunk of debt sitting idle in bank balance sheets at least till the first quarter of 2022 will cause significant stress not only to bank balance sheets, but also cause significant issues for banks related to liquidity. This balance sheet pressure will hamper private credit to the market, thus depriving the market of a valid lever required for robust growth.

Another segment significantly impacted by the current crisis is the construction sector, which is facing significant economic strains. This sector too is highly leveraged and have very high exposure in bank balance sheets. This asset class is also candidate to stress bank balance sheets, once again impairing private credit growth.

Sir, another contributor to growth is consumer spending. With significant scaling down of businesses and lack of industry activity, the consumer's wallet will be impacted on. With credit card outstanding also ballooning in the post-COVID era, there is going to be added pressure on the consumer's wallet and consumer spending, in the short term, will move in a downward trajectory, thus negatively impacting on growth once again. The banking industry, as a whole, will be significantly impacted on by all of the above and in an environment where regulatory capital requirement pressures are mounting, all of the above are going to further impact on bank balance sheets. In this backdrop, the banking industry, as a whole, will lose its vibrancy especially in relation to private credit, which is a significant catalyst to boost GDP growth. Therefore, in this backdrop, a forecast of 6 per cent GDP growth per annum, in the short term, is very ambitious and may distort other economic indicators.

Sir, now let me deal with another matter. It is obvious why you have not spelled out a fiscal stimulus package. There is simply no fiscal space to provide relief to the vulnerable sections of our society. It is high time that we stop blaming each other as if we are paragons of virtue on debt management. Both sides are guilty of borrowing in good times and spending the money without any concern

699 700

for the rate of return. There is basically no real harm in borrowing, but look at what we are doing with our debt. Ever since we went selling sovereign bonds, when the time comes to settle, as we say in common parlance, we are resorting to borrow from Peter to pay Paul. How long can we go on doing this? With terrible shocks to our economic well-being during the past two years - firstly, a foolhardy power grab in October, 2018 which created unnecessary volatility and lack of faith in our Constitutional democracy and then came the horrible Easter Sunday bombings and sheer incompetence we displayed to the international community engaging in opportunistic blame game within Government and from outside - as if it is not enough, those two shocks being manmade ones, thirdly, we now have the Coronavirus pandemic, a God given one, the management of which is being politicized for partisan interests. In all these three instances, the Muslim community had to face terrible trauma and take disproportionate blame.

Sir, before the Budget, there were some talk of a swap facility from India in the region of US Dollars 1 billion. Then, there was talk about a syndicated loan from the China Development Bank of US Dollars 1.2 billion, of which US Dollars 700 million has already been credited. We have to pay almost US Dollars 6 billion in the next 12 months. Sir, let me table* the Central Bank Weekly Report as of yesterday which talks about US Dollars 6.7 billion to be settled within the next one year.

Sir, we are faced with downgrades by rating agencies, somewhat unprecedented in the near term given our credentials. What is alarming is that, when it comes to the risk premium attached to our yield on Government Securities and Sovereign Bonds, only three other countries have a larger risk premium: Zambia, Lebanon and Angola. In the middle of all this, the Government is engaged in divisive, polarized politics only second to Donald Trump and his cohorts.

Demonization of Muslims has become the new normal. The health crisis has been manipulated to reinforce the false narrative of blame game on the Muslims, resorting to virtual ethnic profiling as if we are spreading this disease. A type of Corona racism is being spread by some media institutions also aided and abetted by some among the Government Benches, unfortunately, for cheap political mileage. For demanding our rights to treat the dead with dignity and permit burials as is scientifically and ethically permitted in the rest of the world, we are being labelled as unpatriotic.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, your time is up. Please wind up.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, at this point, may I make a fervent appeal to the Colleagues of my party, four of them, who, the last time, had voted with the Government. May I address them in Tamil so that I can make it very clear.

Sir, on the first day of the most auspicious week of the Tamil political calendar, I bow my head in paying respect to those who paid their dear lives in fighting for the rights of the Tamil people and liberation of the Tamil nation. - [Interruption.] A war criminal

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! - [Interruption.] Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam, you have the Floor. - [Interruption.] Hon. Members, please sit down.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, when this Government took office, the Tamil National Peoples Front had no illusions that this Government is not going to address the Tamil national question. That they have no idea of finding a political solution to the Tamil national question was not something that we doubted. Neither did we doubt their willingness to look at war crime charges and make sure that such crimes do not take place in the future.

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Investigate both sides.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Yes, both sides. We are not shying away. ( ) (The Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

Do not forget what the LTTE had done. The LTTE was murdering innocent women, innocent children and they were also murdering Buddhist priests! - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. G.G. Ponnamblam, you have the Floor.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, we had no doubt that the Government will not look at those two key issues that the Tamils consider important. But, there was one thing that the TNPF thought this Government might actually look into and that is development because His Excellency the President and the Prime Minister, on numerous occasions, have been telling that there is no ethnic problem in this country and that development will sort it out. For the last 30 odd years or even more, in fact, since the Federal Party took to the main stream of leadership in Tamil politics and since Tamil leaders did not join the Government of the day, take up ministerial portfolios and work for their people, the people have not got development and that is the issue. Therefore, we expected that they will provide

709 710

with development and will make sure that the North and the East that had been battered for over 30 years in war will be rebuilt and the peoples economy will be strengthened where the people can revive and survive. That was the expectation we had from this Government, that at least when it comes to the question of development and economy, they would try and be fair and recognize - [Interruption.] Could you listen? We expected that they would try and be fair in recognizing the difference in the North and the East, that they would recognize the fact that for 32 years, the North and the East have been demolished, that the peoples economy has been smashed and that for a good part of the 32 years, the North and the East had an economic embargo where a litre of petrol used to cost as much as over Rs. 1,500. People could not fish. - [Interruption.] The North-East economys mainstay is fishing and agriculture. People could not fish; people could not do agriculture. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Vast tracts of land were no-go zones in the Jaffna District when General Sarath Fonseka was the Jaffna Commander. He knows, for security reasons at that time, almost 30 per cent of the Jaffna District was under military control, that it was a high security zone.

( ) (The Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Please, do not take my time. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, I will not deduct it from your time. ( ) (The Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka) Yes, I know that agriculture and everything was destroyed, but it was not due to the actions of the military, but due to the actions of the terrorists.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Could you listen? ( ) (The Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka) I am listening and I am answering you! ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Ponnambalam, you have the Floor again. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I do not want an answer. Just listen! ( ) (The Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka) You mentioned my name!

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sit down and listen!

So, that was just one example. Thirty per cent of the Jaffna District was under military rule; it was a high security zone where people could not go. That was the state the Tamil people were in for over 32 years. When you came out of this war, regardless of the fact that the ethnic question still stands and that the military and the Government is accused of heinous crimes - we will keep that aside for a moment - at least on the question of development, one expected that this Government which has been trying to say that development -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) My question is this. Hon. Presiding Member, why is it that on the question of development, this Government refuses to accept that the North and the East which have been battered by a war should be seen separately? - [Interruption.] Why is it that this Government cannot declare the North and the East as a war-affected area and why is it that this Government cannot first protect the very vulnerable people of the North and the East and their economy so that at least in the future, they can - [Interruption.] One day - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . Point of Order .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) People expected that at least this Government would do that because they claim to be centre-left. - [Interruption.] The Hon. Vasudevea Nanayakkara is here. It is the Left's cornerstone principle that vulnerable people must be protected, that vulnerable economies must be protected and built. The Hon. Prime Minister is a leftist at heart. He should have made sure that the vulnerable people who had been facing a war situation for 32 years should be protected, that those peoples economy should have been protected, but that has not been done. - [Interruption.] So, you have failed even on the question of development as that has not been done. You expect those peoples economy, which has been battered for 32 years, to compete with the economy of the rest of the country. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . Order, please! - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, this Governments intention, I say with utmost respect and responsibility, is to perpetuate pauperization of the North and the East. - [Interruption.] It is to perpetuate pauperization of the North and the East to a point where the Tamil people leave this country! Instead of building up the economy of the people of the North and the East, what you are doing is building infrastructure. You are spending billions on infrastructure. - [Interruption.] When this country cannot afford to build roads, you are making them. Why? You are making roads to make sure that the pauperized Tamil people have no way to compete and that they leave the North and the East. You create the infrastructure for colonization to take place. That is what is happening because no sensible, left-thinking Government would prioritize infrastructure over a pauperized population. - [Interruption.] So, that is what you are doing; that is the reality. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Under the Head of Agriculture, the Hon. Minister of Finance stated that he wants every inch of agricultural land used. That is correct. Every inch of agricultural land must be put to use. The war-affected North-East people are recovering; they are trying to pick up the pieces. They have been systematically driven away from their lands. When those people are trying to go back to their lands, it is this very same Government that is preventing those people from toiling the land. Why are you doing this?

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is almost up. Please wind up.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) These are the people who have been pauperized for 30 years and they are now trying to pick up the pieces. - [Interruption.] The Hon. Prime Minister, under "Local Dairy Industry" in the Budget Speech, says that he wants to increase milk production.

Being the youngest Parliamentarian here, I feel that I speak on behalf of the youth of Sri Lanka regardless of caste, creed or religion. What I say is that we do not want to step back and go back to the issues of the war, which we faced 11 years ago. We are in the midst of a pandemic. I would appreciate it if we could come together, take a step forward and provide economic development, which, we believe, the President is capable of doing. That being said, I hope this House comes together and cooperate for the benefit of Sri Lanka.

Thank you.
