Sir, we live in an inter-dependent world; we are connected to each other. There are those who are prosperous and those who are vulnerable. The poor domestic worker works in the Middle East and sends us the hard-earned dollars. It is by increasing the reserves in the country that we all can benefit. The poor nurse works hard for a low wage when she could easily work in Europe or the Unites States of America for a much higher wage. She enhances our lives; protects our lives. But, in this Budget, there was not enough attention paid to the vulnerability of the poor and also to the falling middle class.

People pay taxes because of the social contract. We have a responsibility, as those who govern, to those who are being governed, to make sure that they are protected. The environment, the forests, must be protected for our future generations. That is what we need to do in Parliament. Those who love this country, live here to be buried or cremated here. Dual citizens who leave this country when things go wrong should not be making decisions for us. In the United States of America, they pay higher taxes because they accept the social contract. When they have no stake here, they will leave.

We need governments that are owned by the people, for the people. You cannot have a tax regime that does not benefit the vulnerable. Therefore, we will vote against the taxes as we have no other option because the vulnerable do not benefit from this Budget. .

Thank you, Sir, for the time given to me.

, * . ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Next, the Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran. You have six minutes. [1.57 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I feel elated at being granted this opportunity to speak during the course of the Budget Debate of this Parliament and I thank the Hon. Speaker for that.

Sir, Sri Lankas Budget deficit in 2021 is expected to be 9 per cent of GDP. The Government revenue is expected to reach Rs. 1.9 trillion in 2021 and the State expenditure will record a new high of Rs. 3.52 trillion. So, the Budget deficit of Rs. 1.56 trillion will be financed via 37 per cent to 40 per cent of foreign finance while the remainder will be financed domestically.

A systematic review of Sri Lankas post-war defence budget reveals that Sri Lanka spends too much on defence and that it is spent inefficiently. I wonder if the Auditor-General has supervisory control over the spending. I doubt it. Sir, from 1983 to 1987, our average defence budget was US Dollars 421 million; in 2009, it was Rs. 214 billion; in 2019, it was Rs. 306 billion; in 2020, it was Rs. 312 billion and for the next year, it is going to be Rs. 355 billion. The allocation for defence next year compared to 2019 is an increase of 16 per cent, which is Rs. 49 billion. The war is over, but our defence expenses are going up higher and higher. Why? Is the Government expecting another war? If so, with whom? Is it with the Tamils, the Indians or the western countries? Whom is the Government afraid of? Why are we arranging for wartime security needs rather than post-war security needs? My suggestion is, if less money is spent on the defence budget, more money could be allocated to pay off debts, thereby ensuring more macroeconomic stability. Are you not cutting off your nose to spite your face? Are you not clothing yourself with armaments, artillery, armour and infantry in the land domain and logistics in the maritime domain because you are suspicious of sections of your own citizenry who had been reacting to your prejudicial, discriminatory and unilateral activities of the past?

As Buddhists, do any of you not realize that you are traversing on a karmic, suicidal path? Buddhism says our actions today fashions our life tomorrow. If we think outside the box, so to say, today and act accordingly, our path tomorrow might lead us to prosperity and contentment. Let me place my view straight. The Sinhalese are getting to be in readiness for war because you suspect the Tamils. Is it not suspicion, fear and hatred that drives you to arm yourself so lavishly with newer and newer armaments at great cost? As a result, have we not swelled up our national debt, a debt prejudicial to you as well as to us?

Why do you not think of mending your fences with the Tamil-speaking and obtaining the goodwill of lakhs and lakhs of Tamils driven away by you and living abroad? What stands between reconciliation and prosperity, on the one hand, and you, on the other, is the hesitancy by you to take the correct decision, the decision that would reconcile all ethnic groups in this Island. It was King Ashoka who realized the futility of war, violence and vindictiveness. On realization, he changed the course. The time has come for a change of course in the Sri Lankan history also. With two-thirds majority in Parliament, you could bring peace, reconciliation and prosperity or death, damage and destruction. The choice is yours.

Acknowledge that you have committed immense wrongs to the Tamil Community and try to mend your differences with us. All we want is the right to look after ourselves in our traditional areas and govern it the way we want. That is not separation; that is devolution. That gives meaning to the theory of subsidiarity. According to this theory, political decisions must be taken at the local level rather than by a central authority. We do not want outsiders to expropriate our assets and resources. We do not want our lands to be grabbed away anymore by

outsiders. We want to govern our areas in accordance with our traditions and conventions. We want to do our fishing by ourselves in our traditional areas. We contributed up to 43 per cent of the fish needed by this country in 1983. Now, our fishermen are constricted and curtailed from going out to the sea by the Navy as well as fishermen from elsewhere. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Hon. Member, please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Sir, give me just one more minute.

The Government must therefore focus more on the North and the East, which lag behind the other provinces in terms of development due to the war that lasted for nearly 30 years. Even eleven years after the end of the war, the Northern and the Eastern Provinces remain the regions with the highest poverty headcount ratio. While the countrys poverty headcount ratio, that is, the proportion of the population living below the poverty line, was 4.1 per cent in 2016, the Northern and the Eastern Provinces had poverty headcount ratios of 7.7 per cent and 7.3 per cent respectively. According to data from the Department of Census and Statistics, all four districts with double-digit poverty headcount ratios are in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces.

The unemployment rate in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces remains high, indicating the lack of job creation during the post-conflict era. Almost after a decade since the end of the war, most of the districts in the Northern Province have the highest unemployment rates in the country. According to the Labour Force Survey conducted by the Department of Statistics in Sri Lanka, the unemployment rate in Jaffna remains high, higher than elsewhere.

The need of the hour, therefore, is a change of heart among the powers that be among the Sinhalese. A change of heart on your part would have immense, pleasant consequences. You must take us into your confidence. An Hon. Members spoke of confidence a little while ago. Therefore, you must take us into your confidence.

Todays position as far as the Tamil-speaking are concerned is pathetic. After 11 years since the war ended, the war-affected provinces still lag behind the rest of the country economically. So, it is time that you granted self-government to the North and the East and allow us and our diaspora to help you and us economically. Let us together move this country towards peace and prosperity!

I thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees)The next speaker is the Hon. Kanaka Herath. You have seven minutes.
