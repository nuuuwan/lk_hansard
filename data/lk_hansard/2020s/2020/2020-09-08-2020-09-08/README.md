( ( - ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena - Minister of Foreign and the Leader of the House of Parliament) - ] It can be done only by way of a Substantive Motion. It is only by way of a Substantive Motion that another Hon. Members conduct can be questioned. That is what the Standing Orders state. Just because some Member gets up and says, I raise a point of Order, it is not a point of Order. An Hon. Member who has taken the Oath before you, Sir, and taken his Seat has equal rights and responsibilities as other Hon. Members do. So, the Hon. Member who came and took Oath before you today has his rights. If there is a legal matter, it is up to the courts to decide. ]

Whereupon THE HON. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. SHANAKIYAN RAJAPUTHIRAN RASAMANICKAM took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam please. You have 15 minutes.

[4.06 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam) Mr. Presiding Member, I was actually hoping to congratulate the Hon. Deputy Speaker on his election. Unfortunately, he left the chair before I could do that.

Sir, the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. (Prof.) Ranjith Bandara states in its second paragraph about the Central Bank Report for 2019. It states, I quote:

Specially the Report has presented the background required to gain a comprehensive understanding on the massive setback the economy of our country has suffered within the period from 2015-2019 as compared to 2005-2015, in a scientific manner. Further, the content of this report can be made use of, to identify these sectors we need to pay our attention to determine the Macroeconomic targets we plan to achieve and to identify the policy strategies in the formation of policies in the coming years.

In that respect, Sir, I wish to point out to you that the respected Governor of the Central Bank, Professor W.D. Lakshman, visited Jaffna. In todays newspapers, particularly in the Daily FT, there is a news item which states that he had many meetings. Sir, the news item titled Central Bank Chief visits Jaffna, discusses financial inclusion and regulation in the "Daily FT" of today states, I quote:

The meeting was held to gain insight on issues encountered by the public in dealing with formal and informal financial institutions, including the micro-finance institutions and to look for participatory solutions for the issues.

Sir, the question of debt, particularly with regard to microfinance became a suicidal issue in the North and the East, soon after the war. This Adjournment Debate tries to portray the Central Bank Report as something that only points out the disastrous situation of the country from 2015 to 2020. But, if you actually look at the situation of the people of the North and the East, particularly the Tamil people who had faced a war for nearly 30 years, where their areas were declared "no-go zones", where complete economic embargoes were very rigorously adhered to for so many decades, you would see that those people today lag behind 30 years in their economic strength; they are unable to compete. Their financial

situation is so dire that soon after the war, when the incumbent Hon. Prime Minister was President and also the Finance Minister then, these microfinance institutions sprung up like mushrooms. They sprung up because those people affected by war for over 30 years were asked to compete with the rest of the country with absolutely no effort made to try and create a level playing field for them, to create a situation where you can have some progressive policies declared for the North-East, the war-affected area, to protect those peoples economy first, allowing it to somehow grow to a point where those people can, to some extent at least, try and compete with the rest of the country. None of that was done.

On the contrary, the then Government just turned a complete blind eye and allowed all sorts of institutions to spring up. As a result, those people, when they were asked to compete with the rest of the country, were forced to take loans. That is what actually happened. And they took loans. They took loans to the extent that these scrupulous financial institutions bankrupted them. The suicide rate in the North and the East increased not just among smallholders, but even among middle to large-scale businessmen who were unable to furnish their loans. The rate of suicide among the business community and traders in the North and the East actually increased after the war. You would expect the situation to be dire economically during the war, but actually it became far worse after the war.

So, if you look at the financial situation, particularly with regard to loans and the debt situation of the people of the North and the East, you would see that the foundation for it was laid when His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa was President and the Finance Minister. The then Governor of the Central Bank is also present here. However, the previous Governor came out with a report on microfinances and in fact, said that except for major recognized banks and major financial institutions, it was those small, unregulated financial institutions that created this mess. So, I would suggest that this Government look into those problems related to microfinances because they have a duty as it is they who created those particularly in the North and the East, where those people battered for over 32 years were forced into that situation. They were forced into that situation. Even in His Excellency the President's Policy Statement he said nothing about rights, but at least he said that when it comes to development he would create a level playing field regardless of ethnicities. Then it is a duty upon this Government because it is they who created this situation back in 2009 to look into it and actually relieve all of those people who have been plagued by the question of debt. They are actually in a death trap, not a debt trap. Therefore, it is the duty of this Government to do that.

Sir, simply relieving them of the debt situation they are in today is not going to solve anything unless, as I said earlier, you have a policy of some sort of protectionism. Even today, even though it is at a later stage, 10 or 11 years later, to help those people to protect their economy first and then to allow them to grow it to an extent where they can, in fact, compete with the rest of the country.

977 978

Sir, this report I have here talks quite eloquently of the situation right up till 2015. But, there is this huge problem. His Excellency the President in his Policy Statement said - I actually welcomed it in my intervention - that he is going to give deeds to people who have permit lands traditionally, but because of various reasons, which have not been formalized. So, he says that he is going to give them deeds. But, whilst this is the approach that should ideally be practised, the reality on the ground, Sir, is shocking.

In Kokilai West, Kokkuthoduvai North and Kokkuthoduvai South in the Mullaitivu District, there are 2524 acres of land belonging to 601 Tamils. Those are deed lands as well as permit lands. Seven hundred and eighty four acres of those 2,524 acres have already been given to Sinhalese people who are not from that area in violation of the Tamil peoples rights. This is happening in Amaiyankulam, Munthirikaikulam, Sambankulam and Manal Kerni. Tamil people who have deed lands and permit lands in those areas, which comprise of 784 acres, are not even allowed to enter because the military is preventing them and those 784 acres are being allowed to be farmed exclusively by Sinhalese who never had any say or right to that area. The remaining 1,740 acres have been brought under the Mahaweli L Zone Scheme. The Divisional Secretariat of Karathuraipattu had given permission under Circular 2013/1 issued by the Land Commissioner for the land to be irrigated by people to whom that land belongs. But, the Mahaweli Authority intervened and had told the people that those lands come under its authority and the Divisional Secretary does not have the authority to allow the people to farm there and is now putting roadblocks. They are putting roadblocks to the extent that the Forest Department and the Department of Wildlife Conservation are cooperating with the Mahaweli Authority without providing any form of assistance for these people to go there. They are not allowing the mechanized farming gear to be taken to that area; roads are in a terrible state and there is no transport whatsoever. Farmers who take long knives to cut through heavy growth - because they have not been able to farm those lands- are not allowed to take those. That is the pathetic situation faced by them.

But, here we are speaking and commending ourselves today with regard to the Central Bank Report when those people, who have been so poor, who have not been able to farm in those areas because of 30 years of war and who are trying only now to start their lives, are being prevented even now. The same situation prevails - Sir, I just want to mention the areas - in Vavuniya North and Nedunkeni where you have Maruthodai, Paddikudiyiruppu, Katkulam, Mannakulam, Puliyankulam North, Kanchuramoddai and Vinangupiddy. There are 960 acres, again belonging to the Tamil people in those areas, which the military is preventing those people from farming.

Sir, I just would like to mention one other matter. Former President Maithreepala Sirisena was here at the beginning of the Debate on this Adjournment Motion. He,

in fact, visited that area and when he visited the area, those 960 acres of land were being allowed by the military to be farmed by Sinhala people who actually do not belong to that area at all; they never had any say historically over that land. When he went there, these complaints were made. When he heard about those complaints, he actually told those very Sinhalese farmers, Look, it is not fair. These Tamil people who have been farming these areas traditionally must be allowed to farm. After he made those statements, if I am not mistaken, actually, those created controversy not only amongst the Sinhala people there but certainly amongst those in the rest of the country.

Since that is the situation, Sir, if this Central Bank Report is to be taken seriously, I think the Government must act on the ground and in fact, show its bona fides with regard to these wonderful words that they come out with from time to time. If the people on the ground continue to commit suicide because they are forced to take debt which they can never hope to repay, then, there is something wrong.

Thank you. [ 21]
