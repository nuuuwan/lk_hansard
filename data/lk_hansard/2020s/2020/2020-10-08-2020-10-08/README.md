Mr. Speaker, I wish to take a broad perspective on todays Adjournment Motion to establish a foundation for this Debate.

It is 72 years since Sri Lanka became an Independent nation. And for 72 years, successive Governments, including the present one, have pledged to develop Sri Lankas economy. Yet, that promise has remained elusive and still remains elusive. Various explanations are always given. Each new government blames the one before.

In the meantime, countries that lagged behind us at the time of Independence, both in the region and beyond, have got ahead in the race of achieving higher levels of socio-economic development for their people. Even after all these years, we have still not been able to achieve consensus on critical policy issues that are necessary to make us a developed nation.

Mr. Speaker, do we even know what kind of democracy and development we want to achieve? Not even the many cycles of violence that our nation has experienced since 1948 have so far succeeded in making us introspect and unite on basic fundamentals. Even today, we are at each other on constitutional reforms. Those who won elections in the past wowing to abolish the Executive Presidency are now doing everything possible to increase its potency after agreeing unanimously to reduce the same just five years ago. Even our treasured democratic system of governance, in the broadest sense of the term, accountable to a well-informed electorate is under threat.

We hear mixed messages now and there is confusion among citizens as well as us, Parliamentarians, as to what kind of economic development model the Government envisages. In fact, with each election victory, the economic model should not change. We should have a clear and unified vision of what we want our country to achieve in terms of socio-economic development. As a small country, Sir, our relationship with the outside world is a key factor in achieving this objective. Our economic history is replete with evidence on how this Island of ours was prosperous in many eras during its 2,500-year history, every time by engaging with the world. In fact, as one of the most strategically located nations in the current global growth phase led by the littoral States of the Asian Ocean - people may ask what I mean by that and here, I mean both the Indian and the Pacific Oceans - it is imperative that we, as the Government on that side and the Opposition on this side, are on the same page on this important matter.

Sir, we should have been in a position to arrive at todays Debate on the Adjournment Motion on international agreements with maturity and with depth into factual costs and benefits of such. In this day and age of regional production networks where components cross borders, sometime several times, before a good is finally produced, international agreements, particularly on trade are crucial. They could be bilateral or multilateral, but leaders must be able to appreciate the importance of international trade agreements. It was David Ricardo in his famous book On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation of 1817 who explained the concept of "comparative advantage" and how nations can benefit by trade. Counter-intuitive at the time that trade among nations can benefit a nation - this is important - even if it has absolute advantage in everything it produces, the concept is about relative advantage of producing different goods in the same country. Even today, to some in this House, this is "Portuguese", pun intended, Sir, because David Ricardo was from Portugal. They believe that nations must attempt to produce as much as possible

963 964

2020 08

everything they can in one country to save foreign currency. We hear that every time in this Assembly, that we must produce everything we can in this country because we can save foreign currency. Well, this is the irony: it is counter-intuitive, but theoretically you can show and countries have benefited from trade even though they have absolute advantage in everything that they produce. We hear the argument, Why do we need to import when we could produce the same locally?. We heard it today multiple times. It is unfortunate that what Parakramabahu the Great understood in the Twelfth Century, who made this nation great, some of us are unable to comprehend even today.

Then, let us move to the broader sense of international agreements. Unfortunately, today, discussing international agreements is not cast in terms of comparative advantage of mutual benefit, but in terms of conspiracy theories. For instance, to say that the Singapore Trade Agreement would take away jobs from our people and that Singaporeans will arrive by shiploads to take up these jobs. What bunkum, Mr. Speaker! But that is the kind of conspiracy theory and falsification that was spread across this nation. That is very unfortunate. Is this the profile of Sri Lanka that we want to project to the outside world, that this is a nation which is insecure, not honest and not adult enough to figure out how the international system works and which hurls insults at each other and abuses international partnerships and agreements for fear-mongering for cheap theatrics to win votes? It is now quite widespread with our people being misled by various false narratives about international treaties and bilateral agreements.

Let me reiterate that all international agreements always have a clause regarding withdrawal or termination from that. For instance, the recent conspiracy theories and false narratives against the Millennium Challenge Corporation Agreement that were being advanced by someone who has now been appointed as an Ambassador to a key bilateral partner nation of Sri Lanka concluded that countries cannot withdraw from such agreements once they are signed. That is not true. We constantly see countries withdrawing from agreements. For example, we recently saw even the United States withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia.

Although all kinds of lies were spoken on TV shows and public platforms and written about including in mainstream national newspapers in the lead up to Sri Lankas Presidential Election in November, 2019 about the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement or ACSA between Sri Lanka and the USA, why has the Government not withdrawn from it although almost a year has now passed since the Presidential Election, Sir? It was vilified. But, why have they not withdrawn from it?

I referred earlier to our strategic geographic location. Yes, we are most strategically located. However, whether we derive maximum benefit from our geographic location and translate it into prosperity for all our citizens depends not on how successfully we manipulate our partners and play or balance one against the other - that is not how we

do it, Sir - but on how well we work with all our partners in the international community truthfully, honestly and sincerely. A sincere and mature partnership is important. Dealing in lies leads to loss of credibility, which is extremely difficult to regain as a nation. Sir, development should be Sri Lankas number one priority and we should have broad agreement on the nature of development we want to achieve as a nation. Working together with other nations and integrating with them in trade, technology and people-to-people is the key in achieving development. Let me take a minute to say this. When I introduced the 1990 Suwasariya ambulance service to this country in 2016, I was hurled all kinds of insults. They told me that I was a RAW agent and that I was going to bring in Indian staff, which was absolutely not true. Today, I am so proud that I started it along with a 1,500 staff - it is currently being carried on most efficiently also by the present Government - and it has been an absolute saviour of lives. So, that is just a personal experience of mine that we have to be truthful in what we say about international agreements.

Take the recently much vilified Millennium Challenge Corporation or MCC Agreement, for instance. It was the current State Minister of Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms, the Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal, who was the champion of the MCC in 2005. I hear that multiple times he wrote to the MCC. In fact, I think he was the national focal point before Mrs. Dhara Wijayatilake became the national focal point and then, he became the Governor of the Central Bank. The then Government really wanted to obtain the Compact. It did an enormous amount of preparatory work and had multiple meetings and presentations. An entire team worked on it for months and years. In fact, when the then President, the current Prime Minister, found out that the MCC Agreement was in technical difficulty, Mr. Speaker, do you know that he wrote directly to US President George Bush? It was unprecedented, but he did. President Rajapaksa wrote to President Bush requesting him, Please give us the MCC. I have that letter here. But for cheap politics, suddenly the MCC became the most detrimental international agreement ever contemplated when it was subsequently pursued by the previous Government.

Let me come back to development. Development does not mean only economic growth and how well Sri Lankas stock market performs. Development is essentially the structural transformation of the economy, moving away from a rural, agrarian, low-skilled and low-paid economy to a more urban, technology-based, high-skilled and high-paid economy. This means, ensuring that local companies, be it State-owned or privately-owned, have the capacity and institutional culture to move up from producing simple products and services towards producing increasingly complex products and services. But, confusing signals about repeating past economic experiments which failed in 1970s when the world was, in any case, a different place make one wonder whether we want to move back to an agrarian-based economy with import restrictions and adopting a sort of a hermit kingdom model with centralized command and control giving up democracy, individual rights, media freedom and individual empowerment to recede from the international community.

Sir, given the limitation of time, let me conclude. Yes, the pandemic has slowed down and disrupted the movement of goods and people. However, the reality is that the world has become globalized and it is far-fetched to imagine that the globalized nature of the world will be abandoned. Despite the disruption that has occurred as a result of this pandemic and the protectionist tendencies that one sees, it will not be possible for countries to achieve levels of equitable prosperity and socio-economic development that people would desire by receding from the international stage and shutting down supply chains. The lesson the world has learnt through all this, if at all, is how much our destiny is bound together, how vulnerable we are as a species to pandemics and the effects of climate change, which require global solutions that make working together imperative.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Please wind up. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, give me one minute more.

In closing, I would urge the Government to move away from falsification and conspiracy theories regarding international agreements. Whether it is with the IMF in these difficult times, with the proposed ECTA with India, the FTA with China or the ACSA or the MCC with the US, please let us debate facts and benefits that will ultimately help Sri Lanka achieve that elusive development for her. I hope the Government will indicate to the people where they stand in relation to these agreements and how they propose to proceed, if at all.

My strong view, Sir, is that Sri Lanka must not build a wall around her. Instead we must build bridges from our country to the region and beyond. That is how we could build the national economy and achieve our overall objective of development. Thank you very much.

[2.40 p.m.] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) Okay.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, when talking about international agreements, it is very important to talk about the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord as it affects national security. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi asks our Prime Minister to implement the Thirteenth Amendment fully to devolve power to the North.

When foreign governments adversely commented upon the abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, accusing India of abrogating the special status thus far given to the troubled Northern State of

993 994

Jammu and Kashmir, our Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, when asked to comment, said that it was an internal matter of India. So, knowing that this is an internal matter of Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Modi insists on the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment, maybe, because Indias participation and commitment are acknowledged through the facilitation of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord. But, in the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, there is no mention about the Thirteenth Amendment. It was forced on us by India subsequently.

Also, I have my reservations about the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord signed on 29th July, 1987. Did India honour her part in that Accord? It states that all persons displaced due to ethnic violence or other reasons will have the right to vote and necessary conditions will be created to enable them to return to the places they lived. But, thousands of Sinhalese and Muslims who lived in the North have never returned there to date. Also it states that within 48 hours, cessation of hostilities would come into effect and all arms held by militant groups would be surrendered to the authorities. We know that it was done only as a token ceremoniously and India could not stop the revival of hostilities or disarm the LTTE. Even the IPKF, one of the largest armies of the world, could not crush the LTTE and had to return to India with heavy casualties. It was the Sri Lankan forces with proper political leadership who defeated the LTTE and that too, at a very heavy cost where 29,000 were killed and 14,000 were wounded in action. So, India could not fulfil that requirement too. Also, Sir, the question arises whether this Accord was signed under duress or whether the contents of the Accord compromised Sri Lankas sovereignty. One thing we know is that when we were about to crush the LTTE at Vadamarchi, India violated our airspace and dropped food and medicine to Jaffna, which is famously known as the dhal-dropping operation of India and within two months, the Accord was signed, making that incident a coincidental prelude to the Accord. Also, it mentions about the Trincomalee Harbour and the oil tanks. The Sri Lankan courts have nullified the merger of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, which was one of the Clauses in the Accord. So, there is a serious concern about the validity of the Accord and if it is not valid, I think India has no moral right to interfere with our internal affairs.

Sir, I must also remind India that soon after its Independence, there was a separatist movement by the Dravidians. EVR or "Periyar" advocated Nazi-style anti-Brahmanism. That is why Jawaharlal Nehru broke India into 28 linguistic States. In ancient China and many other civilizations like the Roman and the Greek Civilizations, when regional powers became strong, the then empires got broken up and diminished. Ambedkar expressed that linguistic states and political entities will become a stepping stone for creation of separate states. He further said that the road between an independent nationality and an independent state is very narrow. If this happens, modern India will cease to exist. Sir, here we talk about devolution of power for a province as a unit with provisions to amalgamate two provinces. So, India should be cognizant of the fact that granting self-determination to

the North or a merged North and East could be utilized as a stepping stone for a Dravidistan or if not, they could link up with Tamil Nadu. So, balkanization of Sri Lanka into nine provincial governments through the Thirteenth Amendment will invariably affect the existing unity of India. The promoter will then become the victim.

In the North, 99 per cent of the population are Tamils. The LTTE resorted to ethnic cleansing and all the Sinhalese and Muslims who lived in the North were either massacred or chased out. Now, the separatist politicians seek self-determination. That is why experts say power should never be devolved based on ethnicity. The Thirteenth Amendment provides for ethnic enclaves.

Sir, we know that devolution of power, as opposed to decentralization, can result in the division of our nation. So, we do not believe in devolution of power, but, of course, decentralization up to the lowest level. The Centre must retain the power. Our culture of governance was centred with the ruling king. It has not fundamentally changed. " "; a virtuous ruler is the theme that we recognize, respect and expect.

Sir, India and Sri Lanka have a very long history of friendship and we recognize the importance of nurturing that friendship. The first-ever historically recorded diplomatic mission had been when King Devanampiya Tissa, 2,300 years ago, sent a special envoy to Pataliputra for King Ashoka. King Ashoka too reciprocated by sending his own son and daughter to Sri Lanka. I, too, owe much to India, for the Indian Navy and India contributed a lot for me to become a professional naval officer.

Sir, having said that, let me refer to one of the statements made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He insists on the Thirteenth Amendment to fulfil the aspirations of the Tamils in the North. It is respectfully reminded that more than 50 per cent of the Tamils in Sri Lanka are living in the South amongst the Sinhalese and the Muslims. So, if power is devolved to fulfil the aspirations of the Northern Tamils, what about the aspirations of Tamils in the South?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. State Minister, your time is up. Please wind up.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) Sir, please give me one more minute.

So, does that mean that India is not concerned about their aspirations or India is convinced that their aspirations are already met? India must also study why Tamils from the North, in the past years, kept on coming to the South. That is because they know that they are not discriminated against. Also, Sir, the Indian Prime Minister is talking to the Tamil political parties who work on a separatist agenda. The TNA is the political arm of the LTTE, the most ruthless terrorist organization in the

995 996

[ ( .]

2020 08

world and which even India has banned. The leaders took oath in front of Prabhakaran before they came to Parliament. The LTTE killed Rajiv Gandhi, one of the most popular Prime Ministers of Mother India. The TNA has never condemned the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi or for that matter, any of the atrocities of the Tigers.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. State Minister, your time is up. Please wind up now.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) Sir, can I table the rest of my speech? ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes, you can table it.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) Sir, I table* the rest of my speech. Thank you.

* * :: * Rest of the speech tabled:

So, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, talking to politicians of such political parties and addressing their so-called grievances, is like someone appearing for the interests of the associates of his mothers killer. If it is required, he should talk with the Tamil society comprising of respectable, educated Tamils and not with the representatives of terrorists.

I must thank India because she stood by us at the UNHRC, soon after we defeated the LTTE. When there were war crime allegations against us, on 27th May, 2009, India voted in favour of us and congratulated for crushing the LTTE and condemned the Tigers for their murderous acts.

Also in 2014, when the UNHRC adopted a Resolution enabling Zeid Al Hussein to conduct investigations in Sri Lanka, India opposed saying that it is an intrusion of a countrys sovereignty.

We won the war against terrorists by rescuing 295,000 innocent Tamils from the clutches of the LTTE. It was the largest rescue operation in the world. We cleared 495,000 personnel mines, 5,000 anti-tank mines for the Tamils to resettle. We resettled 300,000 Tamils within a very short period. The so-called saviours of the Tamils who are now appearing for the aspirations of the Tamils never came up and offered even a cup of yoghurt to an innocent Tamil child during that operation.

So, I hope Indian Prime Minister Modi would take all these facts into consideration before asking us to implement the Thirteenth Amendment again.

Finally, I must remind India of how she felt, a few decades ago, when E.V. Ramasamy sought the help of the British to chase away all Hindus to create Dravidistan. India should know that we feel the same way when separatist Tamil parties seek the help of India to achieve self- determination.

[3.25 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Madam Chairperson, when we talk of international agreements and when it comes to the Tamil people, one of the most important agreements that concerns the Tamil people is the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord. The Indo-Sri Lanka Accord was signed between the Indian Government and Sri Lanka. The primary purpose of the Accord was to address the Tamil national question.

If you look at the substantive part of the Accord, it talks of various issues with regard to finding a solution to the ethnic problem. One of the gravest shortcomings of the Accord was not making the Tamil people a party to it. By not doing so, India, as a country that intervened on behalf of the Tamil people, has an added burden to make sure that the Accord it signed in the name of the Tamil people is fully upheld. But, unfortunately, Madam Chairperson, the reality is different. The fact is, once the Accord was signed, the Sri Lankan Government was purported to implement the provisions or the substantive part of the Accord through the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the Provincial Councils Act. When both the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the Provincial Councils Act were submitted to this House in the form of Bills, the then leading Tamil political formation, the TULF, wrote a letter to Shri Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India. The letter was dated 28th of October, 1987 and was signed by the Hon. M. Sivasithamparam, the Hon. A. Amirthalingam and the Hon. R. Sampanthan, who is an Hon. Member of this House at the moment, in which they go on to say this. I quote:

Now the legislation is sought to be foisted on us without any Indian expert playing a part in the drafting. The T.U.L.F. expected all along that a copy of the draft legislation would be made available to the Government of India at some reasonable time before it was made public. Apprehending that this might not happen, a delegation of the T.U.L.F. met President Jayewardene on the 29th of September 1987 and made this formal request. We regret that the Bills were gazetted without being made available to the Government of India.

This is not merely cavalier treatment of India but a clear breach of para 2.15 of the Agreement...

And they conclude the letter by saying, I quote:

In view of the above we earnestly request you to ask President Jayewardene not to proceed with the two Bills in Parliament in the present form till the matters referred to herein, are discussed and resolved to the satisfaction of the Tamil people.

So, Madam Chairperson, there is a massive gap between the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord and the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. We are a Party that rejects the Thirteenth Amendment and we reject it on the basis that it does not even form a starting point to finding a solution to the Tamil national question. But, the Hon. Members opposite - His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister - might be thinking that just because the Tamil people reject the Thirteen Amendment, they have an opportunity to throw away the Accord. That will never happen. That will never happen because the Accord is something totally different to the Thirteenth Amendment. The Thirteenth Amendment was a unilateral interpretation of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord by the Government of the day.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up, Madam Chairperson.

Therefore, whilst we reject the Thirteenth Amendment as not even a starting point to finding a solution to the Tamil national question, the Accord is something that we will not reject. On the contrary, we will hold India to account to make sure that it upholds the provisions of the Accord in order to recognize Tamil nationhood in this country and to find a viable political solution that is acceptable to the Tamil people.

Thank you.

[4.14 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for the opportunity to speak on this Adjournment Motion by the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva. I want to just mention two matters since time is short.

Firstly, with regard to international agreements, I wish to reiterate the point that has already been made by the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam here about the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord. That is an international bilateral agreement signed between two sovereign nations. So, it has to be honoured. There is no question that one or the other can get away from their obligations under that Accord. I am saying this because in this House today, a Minister of State, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera, spoke against it. I wish to ask the Government what your stand is with regard to this Accord, which the Government of Sri Lanka is obliged to uphold because consequent to this

Accord, the very Government under President Mahinda Rajapaksa continuously affirmed that it will be upheld. Of course, he said it in different words. He said, full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment but did not stop at that and said, going beyond that and making devolution meaningful.

The second point that I want to make is that whilst this affirmation is made and a fourth Joint Statement has been made a few days ago between Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, yet undermining the process of devolution which you pay lip service to.

Also, I want to refer to a matter that was raised yesterday by the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam and that is with regard to the Tellippalai Hospital. On the 19th of January, 2014 when that hospital was opened - I am saying this when the Hon. Minister of Health is present in the House - the then Minister of Health and former President Maithripala Sirisena was present at Tellippalai. The then President Mahinda Rajapaksa was also present. I was present at that occasion and a solemn promise was made that although this was a specialized cancer hospital it would still remain a unit under the hospital, which is under provincial administration. Health is a devolved subject; so is education and so are many other subjects. But in the guise of National Hospitals, National Schools and various other dubious means, undermining of devolution continues. It started even in the late 80s and it has continued. The Divineguma Act that was passed by this Government when they were in office previously is the greatest example of that.

So, the point I am making is this. The Debate is with regard to international agreements and one that is most important and that is with our great neighbour India is the Indo-Lanka Accord of 29th July, 1987 and the provisions of that Accord with regard to devolution of power are yet to be implemented. The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution may have been a starting point. It established Provincial Councils. At least, the unit of devolution was the province. But, President Mahinda Rajapaksa himself, during his tenure of office, had admitted that that is not a meaningful process of devolution. And that is why those Joint Statements said going beyond and making devolution meaningful. I want to pose this question. A few days after the virtual summit between the two Prime Ministers and a Joint Statement by the Offices of the two Prime Ministers, uncharacteristically and unprecedentedly the Sri Lankan Government has chosen to issue another statement. Therefore, I am posing the question to the Government as to how they come out clean with regard to their commitment under this Accord.

Then, I highlighted the particular issue about the Tellipallai Hospital, where, now, there is an effort to take away the Psychiatric Unit and the Cancer Unit under the Central powers. We oppose that vehemently because that takes away your own promise, that this hospital will continue to remain as a unit and a hospital under provincial government.

Thank you very much.

[4.20 p.m.] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal - State Minister of Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms) Hon. Madam Chairperson, first of all, I want to thank the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva for bringing up this Adjournment Motion on the topic of international economic agreements, which I think is timely and I also want to thank all the Hon. Members who have been contributing to this Debate in various forms. Some have spoken directly in relation to the subject matter and some, a little beyond. But I think, overall, there was a big contribution.

There was a mention made of my involvement with the MCC way back in 2006. That was the time when I was the Secretary to the Ministry of Plan Implementation, at which period my involvement was as the contact point. At that time, we were merely looking at the scope of the overall Agreement. We were not looking at the conditions. We only wanted to see what items would constitute that Agreement. So, that was limited to that particular area only. We were looking at roads; we were looking at railroads; we were looking at SMEs. That was all there was to it, but we never went beyond that because there were certain other issues that cropped up. Then, we did not go through with it.

Then, the Hon. Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage spoke very eloquently about the difference in the ideologies, which is one of the key ingredients of international agreements, particularly the ideologies of different groups which constitute the Government. In that sense, I think we need to reflect on the ideologies of the Opposition as well as the ideologies of the Government, which is the real subject matter that we should be concentrating on when we are looking at international agreements.

As far as the macroeconomic fundamentals are concerned, our policy right throughout has been to balance all the macroeconomic fundamentals whereas, from what we could see, the policy of the previous Government was to aim at a particular macro fundamental and look at how they could improve that particular indicator. I will give you an example. The previous Government was very keen to bring up the tax-to-GDP ratio. They spoke about it. They said, We will increase the tax-to-GDP ratio because it is not enough. They were hell-bent on increasing that. But, what happened? On one side, the tax-to-GDP did go up to some extent and on the other, the interest cost went up dramatically. I will give you that in figures. In 2014, we had actually brought down the total interest cost that the country had to pay. It was Rs. 436 billion. But, the next year, it went up to

Rs. 510 billion, which was Rs. 74 billion more than the previous year. In 2016, it went up to Rs. 611 billion, which was Rs. 175 billion more than what we had paid in the previous year. In 2017, it was Rs. 736 billion, which was Rs. 300 billion more. In 2018, it was Rs. 852 billion, which was Rs. 416 billion more. In 2019, it was Rs. 901 billion, which was 465 billion more. These are macro numbers, Madam Presiding Member. These numbers are actually added up to Rs. 1,430 billion - one trillion and four hundred thirty billion. In addition to that, we found that the cost of the rupee depreciation which was alluded to by the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage was another whopping Rs. 1,772 billion, totaling up the figures to Rs. 3,202 billion, which was a sum of money that came into the Budget to be paid for by the people in this country merely because the previous Government went on the ideology of increasing the tax-to-GDP. These are matters that should actually engage the attention of academics as well as professionals because, then, they will know that this is the only way we can discuss about these things and then go forward so that we do not make the same mistakes again.

What happened to tax? The estimated tax for 2019 was Rs. 2,200 billion, but we were able to rake in only Rs. 1,800 billion. That means there was a shortfall of Rs. 400 billion. This also meant that we have to come up with a new tax stimulus package, which is what is being implemented now.

Then, I think the previous Government also had the ideology that Sri Lanka cannot, whereas we have the idea that Sri Lanka can. That was why, most of the time, they wanted to sell off assets to foreigners, they wanted foreign consultants, they wanted foreign judges and foreign Central Bank Governors, all of which has contributed to the nationalistic feeling that our country is being eroded. That is also an important difference between the two Governments.

Then, they had total faith in international agencies, whereas we have faith in the people of Sri Lanka. That is why they brought in UNHRC Resolutions 30/1 and 40/1, they went to the UN and gave certain undertakings and they went to the IMF on bended knees, whereas we went to the IMF and had an agreement which was completely in line with what Sri Lanka wanted. They went to the UNHRC; they went to India and they went all over with the feeling that we should have engagements with international agencies. I do not think the Hon. Members here are responsible for that. It was the leadership of the UNP at that time which was completely responsible. So, hopefully, the new leadership that is emerging now, like what the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva is promoting, will have a different ideology from that of the past.

Then, they wanted to circumvent the people. The Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution was a complete circumvention of the people, whereas we would go to the people. We are happy to face the people; we are happy to go for elections. So, we have never postponed elections. We would like to have elections as much as possible so that we can test the feelings of the people and give democracy the real meaning. The most important ingredient of democracy, Madam Presiding Member, is to have elections to test the will of the people. That is what we have done. That is how all our leaders have been

1031 1032

2020 08

elected. You must not take circuitous routes in order to come into power, perhaps like how they attempted with the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution. I think it is a kind of circumvention which, hopefully, would not happen again in the future.

So, what are the principles that we should follow in entering into agreements? I would like to very briefly touch on that as well. I think the first and foremost principle is that it must be in the national interest, in the interest of Sri Lanka, not in the interest of anybody else. The Ceasefire Agreement that was entered into previously, the IMF Agreements that were entered into by the UNP Government, the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement and the GSP Plus Agreement under which it was mentioned that certain undertakings would be made are all not in line with the national interest. So, I think it is important for us to recognize that national interest should be the foremost.

The second is that it must be favourable to the country. I heard the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, the then Prime Minister once saying that the people of Singapore were welcoming the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement. Actually, it is not the people of Singapore who should welcome it, as far as we are concerned. Our entrepreneurs and industrialists must welcome it. So, it is important for us to understand that.

Madam Presiding Member, remember that it is easy to enter into agreements. There is a certain procedure, no doubt. It is easy to enter into agreements, but it is not very easy to get out of agreements. So, that is why before we enter into agreements, we have to be very cautious, we have to study them very carefully to see that there is sufficient concern shown. We must specifically discuss with the stakeholders before we enter into agreements. If we do that well, hopefully, we would have international agreements and economic agreements that would bring success to our country. That is the most important fundamental rule we should follow and I want to thank my Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva for bringing in this Adjournment Motion, which I hope will stimulate further discussion in the future.

Thank you very much.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Before we conclude, Hon. State Minister, we wish to know from you whether you are going to go ahead with the Agreements that are now halfway through, for instance, the MCC, ACSA, ETCA, China-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement and so on. I would appreciate, in the last minute, if you can say yes or no with regard agreement. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) Hon. Member, you know as much as I do that these do not have "yes or no answers. These are matters that should be dealt with in a way to preserve the interests of the country.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) ,

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) So, I just want to mention, Madam Presiding Member, that that is the way it has to be done.

Thank you, very much.
