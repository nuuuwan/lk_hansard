( . ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Next, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran to raise a Question of Privilege.

, :

PRIVILEGE: CONDUCT OF PRESIDENTIAL

COMMISSION OF INQUIRY .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker, I wish to raise a Question of Privilege.

I have been receiving several summons from the month of August, 2020 from the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to inquire into and obtain information in relation to an alleged political victimization. All of those summons describe me as a "respondent". I have responded to all of these summons in writing and have indicated that they were in the Sinhala language only. Secondly, since I am referred to as "respondent", to please furnish me with material relevant to any allegation made against me. And thirdly, to ensure that all materials sent to me are accompanied by either Tamil or English translations thereof. I have also appeared personally before the said Commission twice and made the aforesaid request orally as well. Although the Commission ordered that I be furnished with the said material, to-date I have not got any material from the Commission. But, I

continue to receive more summons in the Sinhala language only. I received another summons dated 17th October, 2020 which came by post on the 20th of October, 2020 and I saw it after I returned from Parliament Sittings on the same day. I responded by letter dated 22nd October, which was faxed to the Commission at 9.30 a.m. on 23rd October, 2020 repeating what I had said in several communications previously and also indicating that I had Parliamentary Sittings on the same day and therefore, could not appear before the Commission. I table* the said summons and my response.

Despite the above, I read in the newspapers on the 27th of October, 2020 that at the sittings held on 26th of October, the Chairman of this Commission, Upali Abeyratne had stated in public that several Parliamentarians including myself will be named for evading the Commission. I table* the said news item which appeared in the "Daily News" of 27th October, 2020.

The aforesaid conduct by the said Commission of Inquiry is in breach of my Privilege as a Member of Parliament, as I had clearly indicated by my letter dated 22nd October that I could not attend the Commission due to the reason that I was attending Parliament on that day. In any case, I could not have attended the Commission in response to the summons as the summons was received only on the date of the Sitting, that is 20th October, 2020 and seen by me after 5.00 p.m. on the same day.

I urge the Hon. Speaker to take urgent and immediate action in this regard including action to prevent the Commission naming me for evading the Commission when, in fact, I was attending Parliament at that time and had no time to intimate to the Commission prior to its sittings on 20th October, 2020. I also urge the Hon. Speaker to take action for breach of Privilege, in that prior to the public announcement by the Chairman of the Commission, I had intimated in writing the reasons for non-attendance, which is that I was attending Parliament on that day. I urge the Hon. Speaker, apart from referring this matter to the Committee on Ethics and Privileges, from the Speakers Office, to please communicate with the Commissions Chair on this matter. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I will take necessary action. ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera - Minister of Public Security) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, what is your point of Order? ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) Sir, I just want to mention something about the Hon. Sumanthiran. He is talking about Privileges. He had paid tribute to Pandithar, the Jaffna leader of the LTTE, the other day. Pandithar was the childhood friend of Prabhakaran and he joined the LTTE in 1979. Both Kittu and Pandithar were notorious killers of the security forces and they had killed even the security personnel who were in custody. The Hon. Member went and worshipped the Jaffna LTTE leader. How can he do so and be in Parliament after taking Oath to safeguard the territorial integrity of the country? You must ask for reasons for his conduct. He is talking about his Privileges in Parliament. He went and paid tribute to Jaffna's LTTE leader. Pandithar and Kittu were notorious killers of security personnel. So, Sir, please ask for reasons for his conduct.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker, since my name was mentioned, I will respond, not because the Hon. Minister requires me to answer. I have no obligation to answer him. But, since he raises it in public, I will say this.

I appeared for a lady named Sinnathurai Maheswari in the High Court of Jaffna. She is 83 years old. Her son, who is called by that name "Pandithar" died in 1985. She remembers her son every year on or around 27th of November.

( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) Her son was an LTTE leader. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, he was an LTTE leader; nevertheless, he was her son. Every mother has a right to remember her children. The Hon. Minister has never raised any question with regard to the JVP remembering Rohana Wijeweera with his beret and all his regalia on the streets of Colombo. This is why I said in this House that even in the remembrance of the dead, there is discrimination against the Tamil people. Such low conduct by this Minister who is now raising a question as to why I stood with my client when she remembered her son! The High Court giving an order very specifically said the previous day that she is entitled to have a remembrance event privately in her house. She had that in her house - you cannot even call it a house; it is a shed, that is where she lives - and I stood with her. The learned High Court Judge requested me to explain that this cannot be done in public places, but in the house she is able to do that. I explained that to her and on the next day, I stood with her when she had that

private event, and in the pictures, you can see that her son was not even wearing any uniform. That was a mothers remembrance of her son. She was my client the previous day in court and I was requested to explain to her that she can commemorate her son in private in the house and I was there with her.

Now, I do not need to give this explanation here, - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you, Hon. Sumanthiran.. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) But, since - [Interruption.] The Hon. Minister is standing up trying to say something else. Sir, there is no point of Order. That should have been disallowed.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) This should not be dragged in to an argument. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) |I know. But, he was allowed to raise a matter abusing the provision in the Standing Orders for a point of Order. He was permitted to abuse a point of Order. That is why I am still on my feet explaining it. Otherwise, the country is misled by this kind of racist propaganda.

( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) Hon. Speaker, - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Minister? ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) Sir, please me give some time to say this. This is something to do with the sovereignty of the country; this is something to do with the territorial integrity of the country. He gave just a very childish excuse. The mother can always - [Interruption.] Wait, wait, I have not finished. The mother can always respect the son, there is no problem, but a Parliamentarian cannot go and pay tribute to an LTTE leader who was a notorious killer of STF personnel. - [Interruption.] And, the Hon. Member had the audacity to keep the STF just outside her shed. He was keeping the STF outside her shed and he had the audacity to commemorate that person. - [Interruption.] So, how can he take the Oath? -[Interruption.] How can he take the Oath in Parliament? You must definitely -

967 968

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Tell me one difference between commemorating Rohana Wijeweera and -

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) It would be better if you do not go deep into it. ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) You cannot compare the JVP with the LTTE. - [Interruption.] The LTTE tried to divide the country. You cannot compare the LTTE with the JVP. How can you compare them? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) There is hardly any time for us to go into a debate on a matter like this. Please stop now. - [Interruption.]

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) You are a racist! [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

- [Interruption.] You are talking about the sovereignty of the majority. There is nothing called the sovereignty of the majority. There is sovereignty of the whole country! You are talking about the sovereignty of the majority. How can you say like that? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Both have explained their positions to the House. Let us stop it at that. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Shame on you! - [Interruption.] ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) Shame on you! - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is enough. Thank you. - [Interruption.]

[10.44 a.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Chairman, I move,

"That a sum of Rs. 10 be cut from all the Recurrent Expenditure and Capital Expenditure in each Programme, as per the tradition, out of the Heads of Expenditure Nos. 194, 219, 328, 402, 166, 433, 332, 119, 406 and 115 pertaining to the Ministries and other departments and institutions coming under them debated today, Saturday, 28th of November, 2020, under the Committee Stage Discussion of the Appropriation Bill, 2021."

Sir, I am privileged as the former Minister in charge of water supply to say a few words at this Committee Stage Discussion on the Appropriation allocations and the future strategy of this Government pertaining to the water sector. Now, there is a very ambitious programme that has been outlined in the Budget, the "Water for All" national programme. Sir, I quote from page 27 of the Budget Speech:

...it is planned to invest Rs. 1 trillion ( Rupees 1,000 billion) in 2021-2024 in 1,000 community water projects, 171 major projects aimed at enhancing the production capacity, new water supply schemes and expedite ongoing projects with the objective of ensuring access to drinking water to the entire population. It is also planned to enhance the local value of this project by engaging local engineers and contractors at national as well as at rural level.

Well and good. It is a very ambitious programme. For Rs. 1 trillion to be spent within a period of three years on public utilities such as purified water is a very welcome feature.

I must also thank the Government for carrying on the programme Praja Jala Abhimani which I initiated in 2019. Now, the Hon. Sanath Nishantha is the State Minister in charge of the new Ministry which handles a very important element of the water sector in this country, the community-based organizations. I must say that the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena was responsible, during his time as the Minister in charge, for establishing a separate department for community water supply. But, what in fact happened was - I will come to the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara's Ministry, which is the main Ministry, later - this particular sector received stepmotherly treatment throughout. From the time it was established, they allocate about Rs 200 million each year. It is hardly enough even to maintain the staff. There were hardly any staff. But after I took over, we managed to recruit staff, expand the Department and also began to implement an island-wide programme establishing new community-based organization-led development of purified water. We targeted 1,000 villages. I think some of those projects

971 972

have now come to a standstill, but I am sure the Hon. State Minister will continue to include them and complete this programme which was originally initiated. It is a good thing for the succeeding Government to continue with the project that the earlier Government started.

Similarly, I would like to initially ask the question, since Rs. 1 trillion is supposed to be allocated on the water sector, as to how we are going to find the money for such a large investment. It is a serious question whether it is going to come out of the Consolidated Fund. Originally, way back in 2014, it was the same regime that is in power now which changed the government policy on capital investment to this sector by asking the National Water Supply and Drainage Board to bear the major portion of debt servicing responsibility and hardly any money was allocated from the Consolidated Fund. Therefore, I would like to ask from the Hon. Minister whether this policy has now been reversed and the Government is going to-

( - ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara - Minister of Water Supply) Shall I answer that question straightaway? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, please. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) We proposed to have this money allocated to us fully and also to cut down a large amount of cost that we have been incurring through unsolicited proposals, which has been your way of doing it. We are going to have entirely national contractors to undertake the contracts and the designing will be done by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board. Also, there will be Treasury guaranteed local funding from our local banks.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Wonderful! That is good. While saying that, if I am to understand the Hon. Ministers reply, this is what is said in the Budget Proposals, which is also a good thing. It states, I quote;

However, a significant number of projects worth more than US Dollars 6000 million shows slow progress. The main deficiencies identified in monitoring of project planning, feasibility, implementation are deviation of the projects from national requirements and frequent cost and time escalations resulting in low returns. As such, an increase in the foreign loans as well as the increase in debt services could be observed.

It further states, I quote;

We have given priority to realign or relocate those loan funds in line with the priorities identified in the Vistas of Prosperity

and Slendour socio-economic development programme. We acknowledge and appreciate the support of the donor agencies in this respect. Within the existing loan facilities, we have given priority to prevention of COVID-19, supply of drinking water, rural road development,.

Then, what is important is, the Hon. Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance states, I quote;

Accordingly, the planned annual utilization of foreign loans as agreed with the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and Japan International Cooperation Agency alone is approximately US Dollars 1,400 million. In addition, it is expected to obtain bilateral development loans of approximately US Dollars 400 million.. A key aspect of the public investment financing strategy is the utilization of domestic funds as much as possible to support the implementation of the development of national infrastructure, providing access to the rural economy.

If I am to understand this, the Government intends to allocate from the Consolidated Fund such a large amount of almost Rs. 1 trillion within the next three years which, in my opinion, is a very difficult target to reach if it is to be funded purely out of our revenue.

Then, Sir, I quote from the Business page of today's Daily Mirror newspaper, which states:

Fitch downgrades Sri Lanka to CCC .

What do they say?

Cites challenging external-debt repayment position over the medium term as key reason

It further states:

.Believes official revenue projection of nominal revenue growth of about 28 % in 2021 is highly ambitious

That is why I said that this is a very highly ambitious programme.

( - ) (The Hon. Sanath Nishantha - State Minister of Rural and Divisional Drinking Water Supply Projects Development) , . , ) . ), , , . ) . , ), ) .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, they say that all those projects have been too costly. But, all those are projects have been examined by Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committees, Technical

973 974

[

2020 ) 28

Evaluation Committees and been evaluated and approved by the Cabinet.

Be that as it may, let me also say this. There is at least some acknowledgment that work had been done during our period. I am told that there was a programme prepared to show that during the entire period of the former regime, hardly any project was ever commenced. Now, let me say this. In 2015, Rs. 34 billion was utilized; in 2016, Rs. 65 billion; in 2017, Rs. 82 billion; in 2018, Rs. 109 billion and in total, Rs. 290 billion was invested in this sector, the details of which, for the need to understand the cost involved and the lending agencies involved, I would like to give. Since these allegations are coming about, it is important that all those details are tabled as part of my speech. Sir, I table* the progress of the ongoing water supply and sewerage projects by province as Annexure 01 and also Annexure 02, which talks about the water supply and sewerage projects that are online which, I am sure, will also be considered because these are all projects that have been evaluated over a period of time.

To evaluate a project and to prepare the costing for a project take quite a long time. That also involves further examination of the environmental impact and various other matters concerning the preparation of feasibility report for a project.

Be that as it may, now I must refer to an important aspect of another very valuable project which was implemented with the support of the World Bank. That was, the Water Supply and Sanitation Improvement Project, which was a very salutary project that will come to an end by the end of this year. But, I am told that the Government had decided to discontinue this project. I would urge the Hon. Minister to convince the Treasury to try and revive this project. There is a phase 2 that had been planned.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Hon. Chairman, we are not discontinuing it. We are renegotiating with the World Bank for the continuity of the WaSSIP programme.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Wonderful! We are quite relieved. Why I am saying this is, that project had identified the districts which have the least coverage of pipe-borne water supply in the country, that being Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Monaragala, Kegalle and Ratnapura Districts.

Now, I am told that there had been a phase II that had been planned for Kurunegala, Puttalam, Mannar and Galle Districts. Why I say that it is important is this. Since

our water sector major projects are very costly, they have identified medium and smaller projects and have developed modules and manuals to prepare new type of cost-effective treatment facilities which have been implemented and have successfully been launched in several areas in the districts that I mentioned. Therefore, the coverage is also broad. Almost 100,000 families in the entire country in all those districts have got the benefit of this project. Not only that, through this project, it has also been helpful to empower the National Community Water Supply Department to improve its facilities because that Department with almost 6,000 odd CBOs all over the country suffered without substantial Government capital input.

I would urge the Hon. Minister to consider another suggestion that I would like to make. Try and persuade the World Bank, the ADB or a multilateral agency to organize a refinance scheme through the Central Bank, utilizing a certain portion of the funds to allow the CBOs which are running these community-assisted projects to have some capital towards expansion of their projects and also to fund the infrastructure needs of pipe laying and various other requirements because all those CBOs are suffering all over the country without substantial financial support. Since finance is costly, they are unable even to have access to finance. Therefore, it would be useful for a -

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Hon. Member, in order to formulate your positions more clearly, I must say that the National Community Water Supply Department now finances all the CBOs which need finance in order to rehabilitate the former projects. As you know, for the new projects, we provide 70 per cent.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I understand that. Now, what I am saying is, the principle of CBO-led water projects is to allow them some autonomy, not to be nose-led by the Department. The Department is there just to supervise their work, not to take over the responsibility. They must take over the responsibility to manage and to expand. That is the purpose. ( ) (The Hon.

Since the Government proposes to utilize some of the multilateral agency funding, I would like to say this.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Member, your time is almost over. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I am just winding up, Sir.

Vee Oya and Yatimahana Reservoirs are exclusively for water supply schemes and I would also urge the Hon. Minister to consider the Heda Oya Scheme which will service both the Moneragala-Siyambalanduwa area as well as the Pottuvil area.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Hon. Member, it is already underway. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Thank you very much. So, together with those, I would urge the Galaha-Delthota Project, which will

utilize the Loolkandura Reservoir as a source, also to be implemented.

Hon. Chairman, very shortly, I would like to point out the projects we had done. A Joint Study Agreement with Total and Equinor for Blocks JS5 and JS6 was implemented. We commenced a joint study with French oil giant Total in 2016. We conducted Sri Lankas largest 2D seismic survey in 2018. The Norwegian oil giant Equinor also joined the joint study in 2019. This is the first time the worlds oil majors joined Sri Lankas exploration efforts.

What is the current status? Total and Equinor both, via a letter in September this year, exited from Sri Lanka. They say it is due to a geological issue, but that is not the true story because the same geological challenges they had in 2019 still exist. The reason is, the investors are leaving purely because of loss of confidence and because of mismanagement of investors by the Ministry, I am sad to say. We started airborne gravity and magnetic surveys in Mannar and the Cauvery Basins. The contract was awarded to Scottish based BelGeospace Company after a competitive bidding process in August, 2019. Today, what is the status? The Ministry of Energy is yet to issue them authorization to carry out operations. After one year, you cannot even give the authorization. This is crazy. Hon. Minister, even the full investment for the survey had been secured from the International Oil and Gas Operators through BelGeospace. So, the investment was also provided, not the country. But, you have not been able to move forward.

Hon. Chairman, a multi-client agreement with Schlumberger Limited was signed. An agreement was entered into between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Worlds largest oil field services company Schlumberger in 2018 by our Government. The largest ever multi-client and seismic survey was carried out by Schlumberger in the Mannar Basin of Sri Lanka. Since then, they have successfully marketed the full Mannar Basin database to Petronas in Malaysia. By the end of 2019, we convinced Petronas to come in. We also started a data reprocessing project, which was also started in October, 2019, with Schlumberger. What is the current status? No new projects have been started with the new Government, sadly. If this Government has at least the opportunity to go to Petronas, talk to them and negotiate with them, it is only because the Mannar Basin data was licensed during our Government and we were able to offer that position to Petronas. So, we achieved all that.

Now, let us look at what we did to the petroleum industry and at the history. ). , - ) - . ), 2((( 2(14 . ) ,

Whereupon THE HON. WEERASUMANA WEERASINGHE left the Chair, and THE HON. AJITH RAJAPAKSE took the Chair.

[2.43 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you for giving me this opportunity.

Sir, the biggest problem faced by the youth of this country is the economic problem and lack of opportunity. We saw this Government raising the age of retirement from 55 to 60 years. This will really cause a problem to the youth of this country. I recognize the fact that the Government does require experienced as well as knowledgeable staff. However, this policy will lead to a brain drain in this country. Therefore, I would urge the Government to take immediate steps to follow the policy popularly known as "reverse brain drain". That is to try and attract the youth of this country living overseas or studying abroad to come back bringing their expertise and knowledge to this country.

Under the 100,000 jobs programme, the Government announced correctly that they want to empower and give jobs to the youth. However, what really happened to the Presidents programme? The Presidents programme was aimed at giving the unemployed youth the opportunity. But, unfortunately, because of the politics of it, the

1037 1038

[

2020 ) 28

Government MPs and organizers took hold of this programme, kidnapped this programme and the jobs were being given on a political basis. It is very sad because I think, as a Government that has nearly a two-thirds majority in Parliament, you could have really turned these job vacancies and opportunities around and it is also sad that His Excellency the President succumbed to political pressures.

I urge the Government to look at the Report of the Presidential Commission on Youth presented in 1990. The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris was a member of that Commission. The Report of that Commission basically mentioned a word that is in use today as well: "meritocracy" , . youth empowerment programme .

1990 programme - the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silvas "Suvaseriya" Programme - , I saw in the news a couple of days ago that a certain number of youth who had spoke about their issues have been suspended for expressing their personal views. Is this how the Government encourages and empowers our youth? They went through a rigorous training programme in India and afterwards, they came and started working here. Anyway, I urge the Minister of Youth and Sports to look into this issue although "Suwaseriya" comes under the Ministry of Health. It is up to the Ministry of Youth and Sports to ensure that no unfair treatment is meted out to them. It is really shocking that these youth were to face such issues.

Also, the abuse of substance by the youth is a big issue faced in this country. ) ) .

) , in 1982, my late father the Hon. Gamini Dissanayake obtained the Test status for this country. At that time, cricket was known as a "gentlemens game." No cricket was played at village level. Really, we did not have the infrastructure to promote it. But I remember the euphoria that was created at that time in this country when we obtained the Test status. I see that the young Hon. Minister, my Friend Hon. Namal Rajapaksa, has started another new venture, LPL T20. I wish him every success in this endeavour. But, there are issues raised as to the funding of the LPL. I urge the Hon. Ministers to answer this question in their reply speeches very clearly, as to how the LPL is being funded and where the money is coming from. Sir, Sri Lankans are very talented. We have hand-eye coordination. We are not like the westerners or the Europeans. So, we must concentrate on sports that we are capable of winning. It is very important. Like we won the Cricket World Cup in 1996, if we concentrate on stamina building and team building exercises, I truly feel that in games such as badminton and baseball, we can win internationally.

Sir, I need to ask another question. We had the Commonwealth International Week from the 2nd of November to the 6th of November. Sadly, I have been

informed that no official from the Ministry of Youth and Sports attended this Conference. Therefore, I would urge the Hon. Minister to look into these issues so that our Government could be represented at future events.

We also have the Commonwealth Youth Council which conducts a series of programmes. Again, I would urge the Hon. Minister to get involved in these programmes, represent this country and to send relevant officials to these functions and events.

Then, Sir, the Fitch Rating on Sri Lanka has been downgraded, as of yesterday, to "CCC". This will definitely affect our sports and youth activities in our country.

Again, I want to raise the question on the treatment of Shani Abeysekara. It sends a very dangerous signal to all government officials, that if you do not toe the Governments line, you will be dealt with like Shani Abeysekara.

( ) (The Hon. Harshana Rajakaruna) No, you should be corrected. It was not started during his time. It was started when the Hon. Rauff Hakeem was the Minister of Water Supply. I also attended the inauguration ceremony in Biyagama. So, it was initiated during the Yahapalana Government. But I am happy that it has been completed. So, please correct yourself. I know that there were a few opening ceremonies and the country was misled that it was initiated prior to the previous Government. However, I am very happy that -
