() . ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Next, Question under Standing Order 27(2) to be raised by the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. Hon. Member, you can raise the Question, but it has not been notified by you in advance to the Hon. Leader of the House. So, you would not get a reply today. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Speaker, yesterday when the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena was in the Chamber, I had it hand-delivered to him. But, the Table Office contacted me this morning saying that the Leader of the House had not received it. I find that quite remarkable because it was hand-delivered. In fact, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena acknowledged and waved at me when I hand-delivered it. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) The Hon. Leader of the House will reply to you in this regard. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Speaker, there is a procedure to follow on this. That procedure has not been followed. Just because I get a document addressed to the Hon. Prime Minister, I cannot act on it unless the procedure is followed. Sir, if you want, you could give a Ruling on it, but the Hon. Member cannot just distribute a Question and expect an Answer. There is a procedure to be followed under Standing Order 27(2). - [Interruption.] No, it has to go through the procedure. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, you can raise the Question, but the Reply will be given later. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Speaker, you made the point that I had not followed the procedure because the Hon. Leader of the

House had not received it. I got it hand-delivered to the Hon. Leader of the House in this Chamber and he acknowledged it. Not only that, I personally went to the Prime Ministers Office because I have addressed the Question to the Hon. Prime Minister and delivered it. There is nothing in the Standing Orders that tells me to do any of that. In fact, all I have to do is to deliver it to the Secretary-General, which I did in the morning personally. On top of that, to keep the Hon. Leader of the House informed, I hand-delivered it to him also. So, I cannot understand how much more I can do. If the point that is being made is that I should not be giving it to the Hon. Leader of the House, but rather to his Office, I find that quite preposterous. Anyway, I will raise the Question. I think it is quite obvious that the Government does not want to respect me in answering the Question today, but that is quite all right. Let me at least raise the Question. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Leader of the House? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, we respect any Hon. Member raising a Question, if the correct procedure is followed. This letter has been addressed to the Secretary-General. If the Hon. Speaker gives a Ruling allowing the Hon. Member to raise the Question, that is a different matter, but please follow the correct procedure. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) What is the correct procedure, Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena? ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) It has to be handed over to the Hon. Leader of the House in advance. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is what I told him. Hon. Member, you raise the Question and the Reply would be given later. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) It is quite disrespectful to say that the Hon. Leader of the House -

3109 3110

[ ]

2020 10

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is how I was informed. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) The Hon. Speaker is making an allegation that I have not followed the procedure. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) It is not an allegation.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, let me just tell you what Standing Order No. 27 (2) states. I quote: "The Secretary-General shall, upon receipt of any notice in respect of any question, unless the Speaker rules any question out of order,..." So, I only have to hand it over to the Secretary-General. Standing Order No. 27(1) also states that it has to be handed over to the Secretary-General. There is nothing here that states that I have to do anything towards the Leader of the House. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) You have not read the second part of Standing Order No. 27(2) which states, I quote:

Provided that, any question relating to a matter of urgent public importance may be asked by the Leader of the Opposition or a leader of a recognized political party at the conclusion of the questions after due notice has been given to the Minister concerned."

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) To whom? ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, you read it - Standing Order No. 27(2) - further, the second paragraph. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) That is why I say, Sir, that I hand-delivered the Question under Standing Order No. 27(2) to the Prime Ministers Office because it is from the Prime Minister that I am asking the Question.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) It is okay, Hon. Member. We need not waste time. So, you had better raise your Question. Then later, the Hon. Minister concerned will give the Answer. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) But, then, those statements must not be made, Hon. Speaker. We also can understand how to do this. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Anyway, the fact remains that it had not been handed over yesterday. That is all. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) It was handed over in the morning. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is right. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) It was handed over in the morning. I personally handed it over. How can you say that I did not hand it over, Hon. Speaker? It is incredible! ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa -Leader of the Opposition)Hon. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leaders of other parties are allowed to raise Questions under Standing Order No. 27(2). There are two ways of channelling a Question. One way is to send it through the Office of the Leader of the Opposition. The second is, the individual Party Leaders have the right to forward their Questions themselves. The Question that has to be raised and replied today has to be handed over the previous day, before 12 noon. That is the procedure. So, I believe the Hon. Ponnambalam had taken the liberty of handing over the Question by himself, which he has a right to do. So, I do not think we need to waste time on this. Now that we are quite aware of the relevant procedure, let him raise the Question and then, the Government can decide on providing the Answer. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is exactly what I said.

QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE -19 -19 PROVISION OF CLEAR GUIDELINES REGARDING LAST RITES OF COVID-19 VICTIMS .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Thank you, Hon. Speaker.

Whereas the World Health Organizations advice dated 24.03.2020 on Infection prevention and control for the safe management of a dead body in the context of COVID-19 clearly noted People who have died from COVID-19 can be buried or cremated and specifically stressed that the dignity of the dead, their cultural and religious traditions and their families should be respected and protected during the pandemic crisis;

And whereas adhering to the said advice of the WHO, the Ministry of Health Guidelines of 27th of March, 2020 allowed relatives to see the bodies at the hospital and also permitted burial of the dead bodies;

And whereas the said Government Guidelines were amended and the Provisional Clinical Guidelines on COVID-19 and Confirmed Patients" dated 31st of March, 2020 instruct that the bodies of those dead by COVID-19 should be cremated within 24 hours (preferably within 12 hours) without providing adequate or reasonable justification for departing from the WHO Guidelines;

And whereas in a letter to His Excellency President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on the 08th of April, 2020, four UN Special Rapporteurs urged to reconsider the provisions in the Ministry of Health Guidelines by taking into account the key considerations provided by WHO Guidelines for the disposal of the bodies of human beings deceased from COVID-19 and revise the circular accordingly in view of the challenges posed by the pandemic, it is important that the Government avoids any unnecessary measures that are likely to raise tension and are running contrary to the respect of the fundamental human rights of the persons belonging to different communities that exist in Sri Lanka. Arbitrary decisions concerning the disposal of bodies of victims of COVID-19 may also have the opposite effect, provoking reluctance of families and communities to report COVID-19 cases in fear that they may be unable to ensure proper funeral or burial rites for their loved ones. Ideally, such provisions should be revised in consultation with all concerned ethnic and religious communities and other relevant health experts and stakeholders.

Whereas though the Constitution of Sri Lanka does not explicitly recognize the right to life, it has been held

in the case of Rathnayake Tharanga Lakmali Vs Niroshan Abeykoon that Article 11 of the Constitution, which is freedom from torture read with Article 13(4), which is freedom from arbitrary punishment, recognizes, by necessary implication, the right to life. The court advanced this argument in the said case stating that the Constitution is a living document and should not be construed in a narrow and pedantic manner. The court referred to the values embodied in the Constitution, one of which is the dignity and well-being of the people, as well as Sri Lankas obligations under various international treaties in reinforcing the right to life.

Whereas in the same breath, Article 21 of the Indian Constitution has ensured right to life and a dignified life under Article 21 as a fundamental right and the Supreme Court, through various cases, has held that the right to dignity and fair treatment under Article 21 is not only available to a living man but also his body after his death. The Apex Court had in Parmanand Katara (Pt) v. Union of India held, "the word and expression person in Article 21, would include a dead person in a limited sense and that his right to his life which includes his right to live with human dignity, to have an extended meaning to treat his dead body with respect, which he would have deserved had he been alive subject to his tradition, culture and the religion which he professed. The State must respect a dead person by allowing the body of that dead person to be treated with dignity

Whereas in the recent case of Pradeep Gandhy Vs. State of Maharashtra, the Court, by giving reference to the said decision in the earlier quoted case, held that the right to dignity and fair treatment under Article 21 of the Constitution is not only available to a living man, but also to his body after his death. The Court, in its order, said, Right to a decent burial, commensurate with the dignity of the individual, is recognized as a facet of the right to life guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution. There is, thus, no reason as to why an individual who dies during this period of crisis because of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 infection would not be entitled to the facilities he/she would have otherwise been entitled to but for the crisis,

Whereas the new Interim Guideline for infection prevention and safe management of dead bodies in the context of COVID-19 released by the World Health Organization on September 04th, 2020 notes that based on current knowledge of the symptoms of COVID-19 and its main modes of transmission, droplet/contact, the likelihood of transmission when handling human remains is low, and that families can hold funerals in accordance with local customs and standards and bodies can be buried or cremated according to family preferences.

Whereas the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka in her letter to the Hon. Prime Minister urged the Sri Lankan Government to allow the safe and dignified burial of COVID-19 victims on this basis that The common assumption that people who died of a communicable disease should be cremated to prevent spread is not supported by evidence. Instead, cremation is a matter of cultural choice and available resources. According to the

3113 3114

2020 10

World Health Organization guidance, people who have died from COVID-19 can therefore be buried or cremated according to local standards and family preferences with appropriate protocols for handling the body.

Whereas Muslim religious norms do not permit cremation, the amended regulation has caused great distress within the community. As in Islam, fire is connected with Hell and burning the dead is seen as punishment, it is of utmost importance that the bereaved families are treated with sensitivity, dignity and respect. Recognizing the grieving process and related formal and informal rituals, through which the bereaved mourn the passing of loved ones, is important for the health and well-being of the bereaved, especially for Sri Lankas Muslim and Christian communities.

In these circumstances, 1. we ask the Hon. Prime Minister, who has stood unflinchingly for the rights of the global Muslim population from his most formative years in politics to date and who has taken great pride in identifying himself with the Christian religion in the past, why is it that his Government is acting in this most arbitrary manner on this most sensitive matter faced by these very same religious minorities of this country? 2. we ask the Hon. Prime Minister what is it that prevents this Government, even at this late hour, from changing its present course and doing the right thing by Sri Lankas religious minorities in allowing burials as being practised by over 190 countries in the world?

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Speaker, - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Rauff Hakeem? ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Speaker, while thanking the Hon. Ponnambalam for raising this matter, I wish to point out, the Government must also take note of this, that there was a small news item under the caption Cremation of unclaimed bodies begin in the Daily Mirror this morning. There are 20 bodies which have been unclaimed by the Muslim relatives, the next of kin. This is a civic resistance programme that the community has started. This has far-reaching implications not only for the Government, but for the country as a whole. This is a civic resistance that is going to have serious implications despite the fact that the families affected are suffering severe trauma because of not accepting these bodies. But, this is a civic resistance movement against the injustice that has been caused to the Muslim community.

So, for God's sake, please have this draconian policy revised because this has no scientific basis! There are so-called scientific groups; there are so many epidemiologists and virologists like the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana. Two or three epidemiologists have said that this is unfair. Therefore, this must be revised. I am pleading on the Floor of this House that this be done without any further delay because this is a charade that is being carried out to satisfy some extremist elements. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, in the course of raising my Question, I referred to various judgments and guidelines. I wish to table* those. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon.

:

The draft Trade Policy appears to be over-whelmed by the desire to augment export earnings, in which the positive role that import substitution could play has not been given its due place. While appreciating the limitations imposed by the market size of the local economy, complete neglect of the potential developmental impetus of import substitution is deplorable.

Therefore, SLAPE opines that any national trade policy without an adequate emphasis of import substitution possibilities would not be pragmatic or sustainable.

Sri Lanka has been more or less following free market economic policies ever since 1977.

It is the position of SLAPE that free-market prescription itself was a cause for present economic ills of our nation. Further increased dosages of the same medicine could yield catastrophic outcomes.

. , . . , there were large-scale import restrictions and foreign exchange restrictions. So, in terms of import tariffs, this is what he says, I quote:

The need to nationalize and simplify the tariff has therefore become an urgent one.

The proposed tariff provides free or nominal rates of duty for basic consumer items that enter into the cost of living and for basic industrial raw materials as well as most important items of machinery for agriculture and industry. Above these rate bands would be fixed the 'standard' rate of 60 per cent.

By the mid-1960s, as a result of the policies and outcomes observed in countries pursuing a policy of import substitution, skepticism about the idea grew and its support faded.

. Ral Prebisch, Gunnar Myrdal, W. Arthur Lewis, Albert Hirschman, Ragnar Nurkse ? :

Import substitution in watertight compartments, as he put it, would diminish competition and prevent firms from achieving scale economies. Therefore, Prebisch proposed that this type of import substitution be pursued not within national markets but within a larger Latin American common market. 'Without a common market, there will be a tendency by each country to try to produce everything ........ under the sheltering wing of high protection ....... without the benefit of specialization and economies of scale. Even so, this regional trade bloc should not be autarkic:

COVID-19 has made us gain first-hand experience about the gravity of what Ian Goldin and Mike Mariathasan call the butterfly defect of globalization in their recent book titled 'The Butterfly Defect: How Globalization Creates Systemic Risks', showing how a virus, having gained pandemic proportions, could keep on crippling economies across the world for over a year.

This butterfly defect has paved the way for us to engage in introspection about our economy and economic policy.

Ian Goldin , .

My book 'The Butterfly Defect' shows why globalization created systemic risks.

That is correct. .

It also shows why stopping globalization will not stop global threats but rather will amplify them.

:

But high walls undermines the potential for cooperation required to manage our shared risks. Protectionism reduces investment, trade, tourism and technological advances, which create jobs and higher incomes, reducing the capacity of countries to build resilience. The solution is in working together to make globalization safe and sustainable, not in working against each other.

Yesterday, Citibank - probably the most globalized bank in the world - issued its statement on the Sri Lankan economy. I had the fortune as a young banker to work for it before I went on to head the countrys National Development Bank.

They surfaced an issue. The issue they surfaced was this. Sri Lankas problem is not a liquidity problem. It is a solvency problem that the country is going to face. Denial is not a strategy. What you need is a debt restructuring. It is clearly stated. All international organizations and banks which are lending to this country are saying something and you are trying to live in denial.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, we are on the final day of the Budget. In the Budget, the Government had proposed an import substitution programme to promote domestic production and value addition. Now, with all these challenges, particularly with the COVID-19 impacting on the economy very badly, it is expected that we need to somehow try and resolve our expanding debt crisis as well. Towards that, while maintaining our economys expected targets, we are expected to look at incentives for local production.

While this is in limbo, we also find a variety of other difficulties we are facing in the region. We find the largest trading bloc that has come about in the Asian Region called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. When the Trans-Pacific Partnership idea was brought to an end by the Trump administration, China took the initiative and have now, after almost eight years in negotiations, brought together diverse countries with different political ideologies together in forming the largest trading bloc. Now, we find that our great neighbour India has distanced herself from this partnership for the moment and perhaps in time to come, they too may join.

But in the meantime, our dilemma is different. We need to pursue our existing free trade agreements. We have a Free Trade Agreement to finalize with China and that Free Trade Agreement cannot simply go beyond the goods because we have done the same with the Indians. So, we have to have an equidistance between the Indians and the Chinese; we have to balance our interests.

3185 3186

In the meantime, the Foreign Policy too has been spelt out as a neutral foreign policy. Nobody understands what a neutral foreign policy is. We, of course, understand what a non-aligned foreign policy is. But now, we are talking about a neutral foreign policy. In the meantime, there is dealing with the regional powers, particularly with our great neighbour India. I see an interview by the Indian High Commissioner today in the Daily Mirror talking about the East Container Terminal of the Colombo Port. This is yet to be finalized and as a matter of fact, that is so advantageous since Japan is also supposed to be getting involved with the investment. But, how are we going to balance the already difficult situation in the Port of Colombo by trying to accommodate these two economic superpowers in coming and investing? It is important for us because it is also understandable that 60 per cent of our transshipment cargo is from India. So, it is, in fact, advantageous for us to do that. But, we have certain trade union problems in the Port, which the Government has to resolve fast and try to see that this comes to fruition because this is a long-standing expectation by these two powers who have been assisting us with immense economic support.

Now, let us take a look at our request for economic assistance and debt relief. Particularly now, the Government is not looking for debts; they do not want loans, but Foreign Direct Investment. This is what the Government has openly asked for from all our international friends. Then, we have also asked for market access for our exports. I have some interesting statistics here. Our entire debt share to China is 9.6 per cent whereas Indias share is far below, 2.4 per cent. Then, the Foreign Direct Investment share of China is 16.7 per cent and India's share is not too far away, almost 13 per cent, 12.9 per cent.

Then, we have our export share to China which is just 2 per cent whereas we send 6.4 per cent exports to India facilitated by the Free Trade Agreement. So, similarly, if we are able to finalize a Free Trade Agreement with China, we may be able to enhance this. So, we need to look at this. These two nations have also responded to our call to assist in debt relief, whereas China has given US Dollars 500 as a top-up loan and India has, in the meantime, responded with US Dollars 400 million as a swap arrangement.

Our Government has very clearly stated that the services trade and the financial sector will not be open for free trade arrangements. So, with that blocked, we have to simply deal with a system of FTA where we would only be dealing with goods. In the meantime, what is the future of the CEPA and the subsequent arrangement, ETCA? These are arrangements that we were to do with India and those have also been put on hold. Our integration with India and the economic friendship with them will have to be further strengthened while not losing out on other advantages with new regional blocs emerging. If we do not, because there is almost 90 per cent of the goods in the new RCEP, the Regional trading agreement between China and the 15 countries that have come together, there is going to be tariff concessions among those countries which would affect our supply chain in a very impactful

way. Therefore, it is important for us to focus on the trading agreements with the neighbouring countries as well as on the impact this new trading bloc is going to create. With that in mind, we will have to devise ways and means of meeting the already existing challenges of the COVID-19.

Remember, for 2,500 years, you have been saying this; for 2,500 years, they have been trying to separate this country; for 2,500 years, they have been trying to do this, but we were able to sustain it; we were able to hold it. We are happy to note that now all communities can get together and have one Sri Lanka. But, I remember one of the Hon. Members saying that there are different definitions for "sovereignty". I would like to know what the different definitions are for "sovereignty". You or any citizen of this country has no right to compromise with sovereignty. I must say that with conviction.
