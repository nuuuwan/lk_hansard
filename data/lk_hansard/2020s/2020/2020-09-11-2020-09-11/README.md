( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Speaker, we, representing the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, wish to associate ourselves with this Vote of Condolence that has been moved to record our grief at the untimely demise of a relatively young political leader who comes, if I may say so, from a dynastic family.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Order, please! .

[ ] .

, , [ ] .

Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. RANJITH SIYAMBALAPITIYA] took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Deputy Speaker, before you ascended the Chair, I was referring to the late Hon. Arumugan Thondaman as a scion of a dynastic family that has done yeomen service to an important segment of this countrys population, the up-country Tamils of Indian origin.

The late Hon. Arumugan Thondaman entered Parliament in the very year I entered this House, 25 years ago. We have both, until his demise, had served this House in an unbroken manner and I have had the privilege of observing him at close quarters, as to his dexterous political moves when faced with adversity. It is very well known that his grandfather, the late Hon. Savumyamoorthy Thondaman, was a master strategist in making political moves. They say that the senior Hon. Thondamans political moves sometimes borders on political brinkmanship and his grandson had, at a variety of times, proved that he was certainly a chip off the old block.

I have had many occasions in which I had seen the relentless courage with which he stood up for his people, particularly when faced with very serious adversities even while he was forced to sit in the Opposition. Though it has been very rare to see the Thondamans sitting in the Opposition, during the last regime, we saw him in the Opposition for quite some time; but he never lost his sense of humour.

He was also somebody who had several times been able to negotiate Collective Agreements with the estate ownerships for the benefit of his people. He also knew how to extricate himself from such Collective Agreements by adopting some rebellious attitudes. There was a time when he wanted to ask for a wage increase and when it was refused, he boldly persuaded the entire estate workers to go on a work-slow policy programme, which finally reaped the results that he wanted. In trade unions politics, he, at various times, had shown the maturity and the cleverness of his grandfather who had, by many such moves, proved his ability very well in how to negotiate with the ownerships of the estates in this country.

Sir, they sometimes describe the Parties represented by the late Hon. Savumyamoorthy Thondaman, the late Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff and us, who have taken the mantle of these Parties after them, as communal parties I would like to quote the late Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru when he spoke about communal politics. He said, Communal politics is not desirable but, however, when minorities espouse communal politics though it is not desirable, we expect it to peter out some time or the other. But communalism of the majority is much more dangerous because the communalism of the majority always comes with the garb of nationalism; wears the garb of nationalism. So, that is much more dangerous and therefore, this is something that we have to bear in mind when we talk about minority politics and espousing communalism. This has been, time and again, misunderstood.

I have heard several times in the House about the CWC and its history. Some Hon. Members in the House were trying to interpret the CWCs politics as if it had nothing to do with the aspirations of the Northern Tamils. I beg to differ, Sir. When the TULF was formed in 1976, the late Hon. Savumyamoorthy Thondaman was very much a part of the TULF and he, subsequently, was also very cautious in espousing the separate identity politics of the upcountry Tamils in a proper manner, so as not to be seen to be associating with the separatist ideals of the Northern Tamils. That was pragmatic politics and I remember that my late Friend, the Hon. Arumugan Thondaman took a very controversial move which, at that time, was frowned upon. He went and met the LTTEs political leader Thamilselvan in Kilinochchi and proposed that the Northern and Southern Tamil political parties must form a united front. But, he was very careful, in the meantime, not to allow that aspiration to be interpreted as if he was supporting separatism in the country. He knew what was right and what needed to achieve was some leverage for his people.

In the meantime, he was a true Sri Lankan to the core and I see in his young son Jeevan Thondaman, who is here, much promise with a big burden on his young shoulders. I am sure he will vindicate the wishes of the vast number of beleaguered up-country Tamils in carrying the mantle of leadership to discharge his duties to the best of his ability, even surpassing his predecessors, his great-grandfather and his own father.

1319 1320

While wishing him all the best, may I also say a few words in Tamil, Sir, though I know speeches on Votes of Condolence cannot be rendered for a long time. I would like to say this very briefly.

[12.08 a.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, on behalf of the Tamil National Peoples Front, I thank you for allowing me to speak a few words on this Vote of Condolence of the late Hon. Arumugan Thondaman.

Sir, the Thondaman family has represented the up-country Tamil people from the very inception of the up-country Tamil peoples politics in this country. The up-country Tamil people have been the backbone of the economy of this country for at least half of the time of this countrys independent life. Despite the up-country Tamil people being the backbone of the economy and having contributed so much by way of blood, toil, tears and sweat, this country has continued to treat that community very shabbily. Even today, the CWC and other political parties representing the up-country Tamil people are fighting for their very basic rights and privileges to be recognized. So, when such cries of a fundamental nature of those people are prevalent even today, to represent those people for decades is not an easy task by any means.

In that respect, Sir, the late Hon. Arumugan Thondamans grandfather, the Hon. Savumyamoorthy Thondaman was a colossus. He was an institution in his own right, not only in building up a trade union movement into a political party, but also going beyond to command the respect of, I think, all sections of this Islands society. But, for a grandson to fill the shoes of that colossus, I think, is one of the unenviable tasks he could be asked to do.

The late Hon. Arumugan Thondaman did that in a very quiet way. I was a Member of Parliament from 2001 till 2010 and I had the good fortune of having to meet the Hon. Thondaman on behalf of the Party that I represented at that time, which was the TNA. On several occasions since 2005 - that is when the plight of the Eelam Tamil

1327 1328

nation was at its darkest and he was a Minister in the Government at that time - when we briefed him and asked for his support, he always extended that support. He was not a vocal man, but certainly when it came to expressing the wishes of the Tamil people of the North-East within that Government, he did it in a quiet but in a forceful way. That reputation stands till today.

I have had the good fortune of having personal relationships with hundreds of up-country Tamil people, people who are still estate workers, people who have moved up and become very successful, some of them may not be affiliated with the Party, the CWC, today, but none of them would ever say that the late Hon. Arumugan Thondaman was not someone who was sincere. They might have disagreed with certain decisions that he made, but none of them would ever say that he is not sincere towards his own people and I think that that is a tremendous legacy to have kept.

Many Hon. Members speaking today on this Vote of Condolence tried to mislead this House, stating that the Thondamans be it the great Hon. Savumyamoorthy Thondaman or for that matter, his grandson, the late Hon. Arumugan Thondaman, despised the Tamil Eelam struggle. That is not true. In fact, right along, they both had identified themselves with the struggle. The late Hon. Savumyamoorthy Thondaman, when the Tamil United Front was formed on the 4th of May in the year 1972, was a co-founder of that organization. And it was only in 1976 when the TUF - the Tamil United Front - graduated to the TULF after the Vaddukoddai Resolution that the Hon. Thondaman decided to take the CWC out of that organization for the simple reason that he felt that when the Vaddukoddai Resolution was passed and the aspirations of the Tamil people was for the creation of a separate state, the up-country Tamil peoples future was not along that path. But, at no point did he ever choose to compromise the Eelam Tamil nations struggle for its rights. The late Hon. Arumugan Thondaman was no different and was like all his fellow Members of the up-country political parties seated on this side of the House; they all have extended their support for the struggle of the Tamil people of the North-East.

It is in that respect that the Hon. Arumugan Thondamans son has to take over that heavy burden and has an enormous legacy now to live up to. I had a very brief opportunity to have a word with him at the First Sitting of this Parliament and I expressed my disappointment that I could not attend his good fathers funeral because we were in the middle of a lockdown and curfew was declared at that time. I was not a Member of Parliament then. The police did its utmost to curtail our movements. Therefore, we could not attend the funeral. But, let the Hon. Jeevan Thondaman and his party, along with other Members and political parties that represent the up-country Tamil people, be assured that the Tamil National Peoples Front will unconditionally support everything that they, as leaders of the up-country Tamil people, do in order to win the rights and the privileges of those most deserving people living in this country.

I thank you, Sir.

[1.36 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member for the opportunity to say a few words on this occasion when we remember the late Hon. Arumugan Thondaman. He was a member of the '82 Batch of the Royal College, to which I also belong and there are two other members of that batch who are also the Hon. Members of this House. So, in the last 10 years, in this House, there were four of us who belonged to the same school and the same class.

I had come to know the Hon. Arumugan Thondaman before I became a Member of Parliament and had the honour of appearing as his counsel in two courts in the Superior Courts: one, in the Court of Appeal when a Collective Agreement was challenged by the Ceylon Workers Congress and I appeared for Ceylon Workers Congress at that time, since the Hon. Thondaman retained me. But more significantly, in the Supreme Court in a fundamental rights petition against the arrest of many Tamil youth who were being arrested at that particular point in time in the up-country and in the capital, the Hon. Thondaman, although he was a Minister in the Cabinet at that time of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, still became a petitioner, and I appeared as his counsel and we brought relief in that particular situation. A whole host of guidelines were issued by the Supreme Court in that case

1335 1336

as to how the police or the security forces could actually do searches in the houses; that they could not enter houses after 6.00 p.m. and the local police must accompany them, the police registration forms, all of that became a reality because the Hon. Thondaman ventured out as a petitioner in challenging something that was happening in the country which brought great hardship to a lot of estate youth and others.

Every person who has spoken in this House referred to the Thondaman dynasty and that is something that we cannot avoid but refer to. The Hon. Savumyamoorthy Thondaman was a person who signed my autograph. In 1977, at the opening of the new Parliament, I was, as a Boy Scout, lining up the steps to Parliament according a guard of honour and to some of the Members who came out, we stuck out our autographs and they signed, and the Hon. S. Thondamans signature is also there. I have followed how the senior Hon. Thondaman worked to bring great relief to the people he represented. I must also make mention of the fact that the political party that I represent, the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi, was born as a result of the disenfranchisement of the Tamil community - of about 800,000 or so - in the up-country in 1949. It was in protest of that Act, to which the late Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam gave his support, that the Hon. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam left the All Ceylon Tamil Congress and founded the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi on the 18th of December 1949. So, we have a very close connection. The very foundation of our political party has its connection to that very sad event that happened very soon after our country gained Independence. Thereafter, the late Hon. Savumyamoorthy Thondaman, as has been mentioned previously, joined the other leaders - the Hon. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam and the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam - and became the President of the Tamil United Front until it became the Tamil United Liberation Front in 1976. Then in 1977, when the J.R. Jayewardene Government was formed, it was with the consent and agreement of the other Tamil leaders that he became a Cabinet Minister. He was somebody, while being in the Cabinet, who opposed the No-Confidence Motion, the infamous No- Confidence Motion that was brought in this House, against the then Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Appapillai Amirthalingam.

The late Hon. Arumugan Thondaman continued that great legacy and brought great relief to his people. As I said, I have been personally involved in one matter regarding a Collective Agreement, which he thought was unjust and even went to court. On various occasions like that, he fought for the rights of his community and did not compromise an inch. He stayed with the Governments in office in order to obtain relief for his community. But, whenever it demanded and whenever it was necessary, he opposed even the Governments that he was a Member of or sat in the Opposition and did his duty by his people.

So, his death was a sad occasion because it was untimely, a great shock to all of us and a great shock mostly to his people. I was personally a witness to that when I attended his funeral in Kotagala and saw the

grieving thousands by the roadsides and in the estates, who grieved so much to bid farewell to their leader.

Sir, I want to place on record our grief and the condolences from our political party as well, particularly that of the Hon. R. Sampanthan who wanted to say a few words but is unable to attend Parliamentary Sittings today as he is indisposed and wanted me to convey his condolences too, to the Hon. Jeevan Thondaman and the family of the late Hon. Arumugan Thondaman.

Thank you. [..1.44

[2.00 p.m.] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Mr. Presiding Member, I take this opportunity to convey my condolences on the death of a Friend and Colleague whom I have known, perhaps, from grade one at the Royal Primary School and subsequently, at the College. We used to call him Thondi and whether he was a Member or a Minister, it really did not matter because we were friends.

It was always encouraging to see how he really worked hard for his people. Like most Hon. Members mentioned here, he was concerned about his people. He always thought, What can I do for my people? I know that for a long period of time he tried his level best to ensure that his people were looked after. Like the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara mentioned a little while ago, he was more than a leader of a trade union. He was a respected politician and somebody his people could go to, seeking redress. I know that even till the last date, he was struggling to get the Rs.1,000 wage increment for the

estate workers. We read in the newspapers that even on the day he died, he met with the Hon. Prime Minister and his discussion had been about the Rs.1,000 promised to the estate workers. He took care of them and as was mentioned previously, looked after their families and their homes, improving infrastructure like schools, medical care and so on. He spoke to the owners of the estates, the plantation companies. I have friends who were also very good friends with my Friend Thondi and who always tried to ensure that he was able to deliver a better life for his people.

Sir, I want to, once again, express my deepest sympathies and condolences to his dear wife, two daughters and son, the Hon. Jeevan Thondaman, I believe the youngest Member of Parliament in this House today, who has got to fill big shoes, not only your fathers shoes, young man, but your grandfathers too.

The Thondamans have been an establishment, an institution in that area. Whichever party they may decide to contest from, they would always win and they would always make sure that they looked after the community.

So, while I regret that my Friend, our Colleague is no longer here, I welcome his only son and hope he will carry on what his father and his grandfather started. Once again, I want to place on record our sincere condolences and also want to wish the Hon. Jeevan Thondaman all the very best!

Thank you very much.

[2.59 p.m.] ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Diana Gamage) Mr. Presiding Member, I wish to express my great grief and condolences on the recent demise of the late Hon. Arumugan Thondaman and my deepest sympathies go out to his loving family: his beloved wife, two daughters and son.

I also wish his successor, his son, the Hon. Jeevan Thondaman, who has joined us in this supreme Parliament the best of luck and hope that he would carry on and continue the good work of his late father, following in his footsteps. He has taken up a huge burden, responsibility and a challenge as a young man and I hope he would be able to fulfil the needs of his people.

The late Hon. Arumugan Thondaman, whose political career spanned over 25 years, worked tirelessly, without resent and with great effort for his people, the Tamil estate workers who face immense problems on a daily basis and go through so much of hardship dealing with issues like their childrens education and womens issues, which I witnessed during the times when I visited those areas.

Sir, while speaking about the late Hon. Arumugan Thondaman, we also have to talk about his roots. His grandfather, the late Hon. Savumyamoorthy Thondaman, made the right decision and took up the stance to refuse to join hands with separatism in this country and chose democracy against violence.

Mr. Presiding Member, I also want to speak a few words in Sinhala. . . .

[3.06 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ali Sabry - Minister of Justice) Hon. Presiding Member, first of all, I would like to make use of this opportunity to offer my deepest sympathies and condolences to the late Hon. Arumugan Thondamans family: his wife, two daughters and son, our Colleague, the Hon. Jeevan Thondaman.

The late Hon. Thondaman was an inclusive leader. It is no surprise that he had those qualities inculcated in him by the great Hon. Savumyamoorthy Thondaman. Sir, let me quote from a speech made by the Hon. Batty Weerakoon in this august Assembly reported in Hansard dated 10th May, 2000, in which he referred to some comments made by the Hon. Savumyamoorthy Thondaman.

"Mahatma Gandhi has been and is still my political guru. His theory and practice of non-violence became the core of my political ideology. His approach to social problems and social justice, especially the fight against caste, the struggle for the emancipation of women and for total religious freedom and tolerance, became my guide to action. Above all he stood for national unity and national independence, and these have been my ideals. I have not strayed from these and other principles enunciated, preached, taught and practised by Mahatma Gandhi."

. . . inclusive approach . That is how we will go a long way as a united country.

. . . not to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. He knew that balance. He knew that there is no point in getting what you want by destroying the plantation companies or the plantations. Though they demand for a wage increase in theory, if the plantation companies cannot pay, the entire plantations would come down. So, he knew where the balance is. He wanted to protect the economy; he wanted to protect the companies while fighting for his people and practically getting the best that is possible for them from those companies. That is leadership. This is not only leadership, but also responsibility. Therefore, I wish my Colleague and young Friend, the Hon. Jeevan Thondaman, a long and fruitful journey as a national leader from the estate sector in this country, uniting people and giving leadership to his people so that we all could march towards a prosperous Sri Lanka.

Once again, let me take this opportunity to express my condolences on the untimely death of your great father, and former Minister, the Hon. Arumugan Thondaman.

Thank you very much. [.. 3.14 ( ) (The Hon. Sanjeeva Edirimanna) .

Mr. Speaker, death is an event where we can reflect on the past or we can decide about our future.

Sir, I will take these three minutes only to speak to my fellow Parliamentarian, my brother, Thambi, if you permit me to call you that, Hon. Jeevan Thondaman, about our future - the common future of Sri Lanka; the common future of the people of this country; the common future, particularly, of the Malayaha Thamilar or the Tamils of Indian Origin in Sri Lanka.

Jeevan, a young man called James Taylor who was younger than you, at 19 years, came and revolutionized this part of the world by introducing tea to Sri Lanka, then Ceylon. You are a fourth-generation member of the leadership of that community. I selected a couplet from Valluvars Thirukkural which states, Great people will do great things and the society will look at them. So, I am looking at you as a young person who will do great things for the up-country people, our beloved community and fellow citizens.

All the speakers I heard speaking today had a very sympathetic attitude towards the up-country people. They said, "We must do something about them. I am emphasizing, my Hon. Member, the responsibility that you have on your shoulders is to make them become equal citizens of this country, because till today, for nearly 200 years, this country's economy has been based on the sweat, tears and the blood of those people, and today, you stand as their leader.

Sir, an average of US Dollars 1.8 billion was earned during the last three years by tea. But, what is the amount that we have invested on those people? That community consists of one million people and casts nearly 450,000 votes every year. But, what is their future? So, my Thambi, let us work for them. That is how you can salute your great grandfather and your father, by ensuring that the up-country Tamil people become equal citizens of this country.

. . . . . . . . The up-country Tamils are not alone. Though my fellow Northern people have not come here to salute your father, I stayed back. I had three meetings, but I cancelled them and stayed back because I want to walk this journey with you so that our people, the up-country people, will have a bright future.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Then, the Hon. Johnston Fernando. You have about three minutes.

Hon. Speaker, I wish to continue in English. Sir, everyone knew that the late Hon. Arumugan Thondaman boldly espoused the plight of the plantation workers in Parliament and also at international forums. Not only did he demand better wages for the estate workers, but also for better housing and a better standard of life in the mainstream society. Eventually, this has led to the plantation community to get involved with the mainstream society for which we are very grateful and are very proud of.

Apart from that, his acumen and negotiating skills in concluding Collective Agreements between the Employers' Federation of Ceylon and the trade unions were thornful at times, but he would always emerge as a victor, the reason being that he was not just a veteran trade unionist, but was Arumugan Thondaman. He was known for his negotiating skills and the strategies he followed.

He had a desire to somehow achieve that Rs. 1,000 wage for the estate workers before his last breath, but unfortunately he could not. But, we will continue the struggle and we believe that we will definitely receive the Rs. 1,000.

He also had another dream of starting a universtiy. I was extremely happy and overwhelmed after hearing what the Hon. (Dr.) Bandula Gunawardena said on the Vote of Condolence, pledging that he will definitely bring in a university to the up-country and within this year, we are hoping to start it off.

I also wish to state that the services of the Hon. Arumugan Thondaman extended not only to the plantation community but also to Sinhala villages and to the Northern and Eastern areas, which is why

Parliamentarians of the Opposition and the ruling party from different areas paid their respect by recalling their memory of the late Hon. Arumugan Thondaman.

I wish to say that apart from that, he maintained a cordial relationship with the Indian Government and also with Tamil Nadu politicians. He always acted as a bridge. Whenever a bilateral issue arose, the Hon. Arumugan Thondaman would stand at the forefront and face it.

I would also like to thank the members of the Maha Sangha, clergies of the Hindu, Islam, Catholic and Christian faith, His Excellency President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and also Hon. Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa for not only being a leader of this country, but also for being a good friend of my father. I would also like to thank Mr. Basil Rajapaksa for standing with us through thick and thin even after my fathers demise.

Finally, I would like to extend my thanks to the Tri-forces, the police, public health officials, the media, all trade unions, political leaders, employer organizations, Members of Parliament, Governors of all Provinces, Chairmen and Members of Pradeshiya Sabhas, former Ministers and Members of Provincial Councils, staff members of estates, the Staff of Parliament and lastly, the people who have stood by my father and who will stand by me.

Thank you.
