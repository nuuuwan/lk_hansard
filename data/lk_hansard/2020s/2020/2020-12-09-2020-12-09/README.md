The problem, Hon. Leader of the Opposition, was that the earlier procedure was very ad hoc; it was an ad hoc procedure. Now, the decision is made on the basis of complete reports which were never available in the past. The records of the different candidates for the Vice Chancellors post, their contribution to the University, their research record, their innovative skills, all of this is, today, incorporated in formal complete reports which are prepared by competent committees. So, when the final decision is made, it is possible to make an informed decision, which was not the case earlier.

I will now explain to you the new procedure and why that procedure enables the strengths, the attributes of the different candidates to be fully evaluated and with the knowledge of all these details, for the correct decision to be made. It is therefore, in my submission, Sir, a significant improvement of the earlier system, which did not make provision for any of this information to be available to the people who were going to make the final selection.

Chairman or a CEO of an established company in the private sector. , .

(3) . - - - it is more objective, clearly - - each element - , .

I would like to tell the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, because I know that he is genuinely interested in these matters, that this is a very detailed scheme for assessment. I will send this scheme to you, Hon. Leader of the Opposition.

These are the matters in respect of which each candidate has to be evaluated; it is all set out here. These are qualities that are very essential for the Vice Chancellor of a university. The Vice Chancellor is the most visible symbol of the university. The success or the failure of the university largely depends on the personality, the prestige and the competence of the Vice Chancellor. So, here you have a detailed enumeration of the criteria: Strategic Focus, Effective Leadership, Conceptual Skills, Academic and Research Excellence, Personal Integrity, Professional Communication and Managerial Competence. There is a mark sheet given and marks have to be given under each of these heads. There never was a system like that at all in the university system of this country. When we were appointed as Vice Chancellors, there was no such evaluation at all.

This is the requirement. The Evaluation Committee Members shall perform a desk evaluation of candidates by examining the information provided in the documents submitted. The final marks for individual elements and for each criterion and the candidates total score shall be arrived at only after interviewing the individual candidates. They were not interviewed earlier. I was never interviewed when President J.R. Jayewardene appointed me as Vice Chancellor. So, here is a detailed and comprehensive seven-point evaluation scheme.

. . . , .

. So, it is very detailed, very specific and very concised. 2/2020 34(1) (ii) . So, that is the second stage. After these names are received, there is a special procedure which has to be adopted by the Council in making their final recommendation. 2/2020 2(14) . , .

Also, I would like to refer to another issue. On several occasions, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and several other Hon. Members in this House sought my opinion as to the present progress of the inquiry and the judicial proceeding pertaining to the Central Bank Bond issue and the current status of the extradition request against Mr. Arjuna Mahendran, former Governor of the Central Bank. I, rather than just giving an answer on the spur of the moment just to satisfy somebody, followed the due process, wrote to the Hon. Attorney-General and sought a clarification as to the present status.

I am thankful that the Hon. Attorney-General had carefully prepared a document and submitted to me the background, the instructions to the CID, the Proceedings in the Magistrates Court of Colombo - Fort relating to the Treasury Bond Auction held on the 27.02.2015, the indictment before the Permanent High Court at Bar and its present position, the Writ Application filed by one Mr. Ajahn Punchihewa challenging the indictment filed against him, the extradition request against Arjun Mahendran and its present position, the continuation of investigations relating to incidental matters, the Proceedings in the Magistrates Court of Colombo - Fort relating to the Treasury Bond auctions held on the 29.03.2016 and 31.03.2016, the Proceedings in the Magistrates Court of Colombo against Mr. Ravi

Karunanayake for committing perjury at the Commission, the Proceedings in the Magistrates Courts of Colombo - Fort against PTL, AA, KP and two other employees of PTL for destruction of evidence and indictment filed by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. So, there is a comprehensive report as to the present position relating to what is happening in respect of the Central Bank Bond investigation. We will not rest until the last person who is responsible for this is brought before the court.

Sir, I table* this document which gives the progress of the inquiry and the judicial proceedings pertaining to the Central Bank Bond issue and the current status of the extradition request against Arjuna Mahendran.

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) That is also there. I can give you a copy of this. Just to clarify the present position, Singapore's Attorney-General has sought certain clarifications from our Attorney-Generals Department, whether the kind of offence which we have charged him with or indicted falls within the First Schedule of the Extradition Treaty between Singapore and Sri Lanka. So, that is ongoing and the Hon. Attorney-General will continue to make representations.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. You have 30 minutes.

[12.02 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Presiding Member, I am glad to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of Justice at the Committee Stage Discussion today when my good Friend at the Bar, the Hon. Ali Sabry, is the Minister of Justice. We have had a long association. He occupies a very prestigious post, that of the Minister of Justice. In the olden days, it was occupied by a Member from the Senate - the Upper House - because it was a prestigious office to hold. However, I think he may feel like the Minister of Ports and Shipping of Afghanistan today.

( ) (An Hon. Member) The feelings are mutual. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am not a Minister. I say this because having listened to the exchange that took place when the former Minister of Justice was speaking between the Government Benches and the main Opposition party. One could not escape wondering that they were both letting down the Judiciary. When you accuse the other side of meddling with the Judiciary, cite judgments that had been delivered by the Judiciary and imply that those judgments were wrong, were influenced by the Executive of the day, then you both are actually letting down the Judiciary. Perhaps, that is the true state of affairs in the country because judges continue their tenure. Governments come; Governments go, but they continue. If you in the House today argue as to which point of time a particular judgment was given and what the political implication of that is, then you are both pointing a finger at the Judiciary, and I am only worried that what you were doing was perhaps even justified.

I am also happy to follow the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris. He made a point in his speech and said that the fundamental rights jurisdiction must now be given to lower courts where people in their own localities can have access to. I suppose when, in the 1978 Constitution, it was given to the Supreme Court, it was a new jurisdiction and perhaps to establish benchmarks, it was

2883 2884

[ () . . ]

2020 09

given to the apex court. But, he is right. So many years have passed; 42 years have passed. Long ago, this should have been given to the Provincial High Courts, at least. There is another reason why that should be done. He said in his own words that it is "the court of first resort; the court of last resort. There lies a problem. When that is the court of first instance and also the court of last resort, we find a new phenomenon where judges feel that they do not have to be accountable, in the sense that they do not have to give reasons. I know that in certain instances reasons are not necessary. But in todays world, when judges themselves find fault with administrators in exercising writ jurisdiction et cetera the duty to give reasons is of paramount importance.

They themselves do not do that and courts that are below the Supreme Court are generally careful to give reasons or very careful when they deliver judgments because they know that there is somebody above them who might review their decision. But, when it is the Supreme Court, that fear is absent and when that is the first and the last court, surely, there is something that is wrong and I welcome the Hon. Ministers suggestion that the fundamental rights jurisdiction must now be given to, perhaps, the Provincial High Court or even to the Court of Appeal, if it can sit in the provinces.

The issue of justice in this country is a subject that paints a bleak picture of the country. We have so many emblematic cases where people have struggled for justice for decades on end and are still struggling for justice. That is not a good thing to say, but that is a fact. If I start listing out names of such persons, it is a long list and most of the time, it is due to the fact that there is political interference into the affairs of the Judiciary.

There is a book called The Judicial Mind in Sri Lanka: Responding to the Protection of Minority Rights written by three authors - Jayantha de Almedia Guneratne, Kishali Pinto-Jayawardena and Gehan Gunatilleke - and published by the Law and Society Trust in January, 2014, which is very revealing as to the judicial attitudes, particularly towards a minority. In that, they start from the very beginning when the Citizenship Act was passed and then come to the cases of Kodakan Pillai vs. Mudanayake and Kodeeswaran et cetera and come down until recent times when issues of minority peoples rights have been dealt with very differently to that of other cases.

We saw a recent phenomenon when the Hon. Minister of Justice himself, in desperation, tweeted - I mean, all he could do was to tweet - about the burial rights of the Muslims in Sri Lanka, but to no avail. Because even that matter was summarily dismissed albeit by a majority decision. At least one judge agreed that there was something to look into, but no reasons were given yet again. Very serious issues have been summarily dealt with like that.

There are other cases where not even investigations have been done. Now, I can cite the Welikada Prison massacre of 1983. Was anyone punished for that? No.

When people who are in State custody get killed in custody, surely, can people be held responsible? This has been happening from Welikada Prison in 1983 to Mahara Prison a few days ago. That is not a good thing. In Bindunuwewa Prison, 27 people were killed in 2000 and in Vavuniya Prison, Nimalaruban and Dilrukshan were killed in July, 2012. I can list out a whole list of names.

( ) (An Hon. Member) There was an incident in Kalutara also.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, also in Kalutara. But the point is, - [Interruption.]

No, I am talking about custodial deaths of a Government that calls itself a "democratic Government"; a Government that says that they have the best judicial system in the country. How can custodial deaths go unpunished? I am not saying that it happened. It should not happen. But, even when it happens, it goes unpunished. That is the greatest slur to a justice system of any country. I think it was Sir Winston Churchill who once said, The soul of a nation is judged by how you treat your prisoners.

How were our prisoners treated? In the Vavuniya case that I mentioned, Nimalaruban and Dilrukshan, young men, were held there on suspicion. They were beaten to death. There were several fractures in their limbs when they were beaten. There were fundamental rights cases filed in respect of Nimalaruban and leave to proceed was refused by a person who occupied the Office of Chief Justice and then, had to leave that post. Now, you have made him the Permanent Representative to the UN. You cannot find a better person. He made comments from the bench - those are recorded in the published works by several organizations and even in the book that I mentioned - which should never have come from any judge.

Now, I am going to refer to some incidents where the deaths were not custodial deaths, but, nevertheless, large numbers of people were killed. Twenty four were killed in Kumarapuram and in Mirusuvil, a few people were killed. One person was punished, but he was recently pardoned. What is the message that is given to the country? Even in the rarest of rare cases, where you want to show that something is happening and there is a conviction in the original court, either the Appeal Court releases the people or even if that does not happen, there is an Executive pardon given.

The Hon. Leader of the House responded to the Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Athukorala about the Hon. Sivanesathurai Santhirakanthans case and said, "For four and a half years, he was in remand". Four and a half years! He thought that it was a long time. I do concede that four and a half years in remand is a long time, but what about the

2885 2886

Tamil political prisoners? He used that word. " ?" . What has happened to the actual Tamil political prisoners? I am not talking about the Hon. Sivanesathurai Santhirakanthan who is accused of murdering a Tamil National Alliance Parliamentarian, the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham on the night of 24th December when he was attending a mass in the Batticaloa Cathedral. But, what about the actual political prisoners? How long have they been in remand? Why are you not rising for the rights of those persons? They have been in remand for 20 to 25 years and some, for over 30 years. Why can they not be released? Why does the Hon. Attorney-General not consent to bail in those cases? Why does he consent to bail to only the Hon. Sivanesathurai Santhirakanthan under the PTA?

In one case, the AG takes the position that he can consent to bail and in another, he says, No, under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, under Section 7(1) proviso, in the High Court, I have no discretion to consent to bail. Why are these double standards? I am talking about double standards in all of these cases. What about the Trinco 5? You gave assurance after assurance to various international fora, but no justice has been done for those five students? What about the Muttur ACF workers, 17 of them? What about the 11 youth who were abducted in Colombo? Where is justice for all of them? I mentioned the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham. What about the Hon. Nadarajah Raviraj? What about the Hon. K. Sivanesan? They were three Hon. Members of this House murdered while they were sitting MPs. The Hon. Nadarajah Ravirajas case came up before the High Court in Colombo before a Sinhala-speaking Jury. Under the PTA, there is no Jury trial, but they were charged for murder as well under the Penal Code just to enable a Jury trial. After a long trial, they were acquitted. The Attorney-General had appealed and the persons who were accused and arraigned as accused in the High Court were naval intelligence officers. The Attorney-General himself indicted them. So, the involvement of the State and particularly, that of the intelligence component of the State was admittedly conceded by the Hon. Attorney-General himself. There are not only these cases, but even others - the cases of Lasantha Wickrematunge, Keith Noyahr, Prageeth Ekneligoda and scores of Tamil journalists who were killed. There is a long list of names, about 34. No investigation has even commenced in respect of one. In respect of only one, I think, there was some magisterial inquiry and that was the end of it. Why is the State behaving in this way? Why is the judicial arm of the State like this?

And it is because of this that we have consistently said that we have no confidence in the Judiciary. Are we to be blamed when you yourselves trade allegations against each other? Just hours ago, you did that. How are we to be blamed when we are almost always at the butt end of justice? So, that is why in respect of serious crimes that have been committed in this country and in respect of international crimes that have been committed in this country that we have asked for international involvement,

an international inquiry and international judicial processes. How can you deny that? How can you say no when we can lay bare before you facts? Not only we, but you yourselves did that a little while ago? You laid before the entire world the depths to which your judicial system had sunk. You were so vociferous. You thought you were accusing the other side, but you were, in fact, accusing the Judiciary and as I said, justifiably so.

Take some recent examples and I want to pick one example of a colleague of mine, Hejaaz Hizbullah, a brilliant, young lawyer - the Hon. Minister of Justice knows that very well - who was denied justice for eight months. What are you doing for eight months? If you had evidence that he was involved in anything at all, you could have charged him with that. What were you doing for eight months? All kinds of false allegations were made against him. When his house was searched and he was arrested, Hon. Minister, they took away two of his case briefs. Not even in a court of law can questions be asked with regard to communication between client and attorney and you know that very well. There are only two instances of privilege - one is, husband-wife privilege and the other is attorney-client privilege. That is how sacrosanct communication between a lawyer and his client is, but they took even his clients' files. Can he not have clients? Can he not handle cases for people who are later found to have committed other crimes?

Is the lawyer to be blamed? All right, even if you did that, in those files if you found anything, you could have brought that to light, you could have produced him before court. Nothing! Nothing to date. All kinds of spurious allegations are being made, something about a school that he was involved in some school. Now, that school is still functioning. Nobody else has been arrested in respect of that school. That school is functioning. Everybody is happily running that school. But, he is detained for involvement in that school. I mean, it is a funny state of affairs, a funny Ministry. He was said to have got assistance from Qatar Charity. That Qatar Charity is still running; it is still involved. The State is a beneficiary as well. So, what is wrong with Qatar Charity? You can have it, you can still use it, but you accuse him of being involved with Qatar Charity. I have not spoken about Hijaaz Hizbullah until today for good reason. If there was something against him and there were investigations, let the investigators be free to find evidence against him. But, after eight months nothing has been done. His wife just gave birth to a child. He has not been able to even see his wife. Access to lawyers has been denied. I know you will say that it was given. It was given sketchily here and there, with a police officer sitting there and writing down every word that is spoken. Hon., Minister, you are a trained lawyer. Is that access?

I am picking one emblematic case to show how many thousands more are suffering like this. I am picking that case because he is a lawyer. If you treat a lawyer like that, how do we expect you to treat anybody else any better? A lawyer who is well-known, a lawyer who is regarded as a brilliant advocate in our courts is being

2887 2888

treated like this. Any other Minister would not want to don the hat of Minister of Justice at a time like this; they would resign and go home. That is why I said that you must be feeling like the Minister of Ports and Shipping of Afghanistan. So, that is the kind of state this country is in with regard to justice.

Take the independent Commissions. Those Commissions are supposed to be independent by the Acts that this Legislature has passed. By that word, it means that the tenure of the members who are appointed to it is secure. There is a removal procedure by this House for cause. But, what is happening? You think you are in the 18th Century where people hold office only during your pleasure. What is the meaning of "independent Commission" then? What is happening to the Human Rights Commission? There are persons whose tenure goes well beyond. Why are you putting pressure on them to resign? Why are you trying to appoint people while you have sitting members in that Commission? This happened in the Eastern Province too. The Eastern Province Public Service Commission was there and the new Governor went and appointed another person as the Chairman of it. Fortunately, we were able to go to the writ court and get a quo warranto on that man and redress it. Next thing we know is that they were all being sacked. She does not have powers to sack an independent Commission. What is the point of having an independent Public Service Commission in the Province if the Governor can sack persons like that? The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan is not present here. He tried that in Jaffna and failed when he was the Governor of the Northern Province.

Now, the latest is this. From yesterday, we have seen this news about the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka. I would have liked the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara to be here when I speak on this because as Minister of Water Supply, he wrote to the Prime Minister and said, This is an important Commission. But, what happened? The Secretary to the Treasury says, We have abolished this Commission. How can you abolish a Commission that is set up by law? The PUCSL was set up by law in 2002 by an Act of Parliament and it states that it is an independent Commission. Executive diktats, perhaps, work like this. If the President does not like something, even if it was passed by Parliament, he says, "Get rid of it" as he said, Whatever I say, my words are the circular. That is why he is called "Sir"-"cular". He is now called, Sir"-"cular. So, that is how things happen today. The PUCSL members have now been asked to resign suddenly. Why are they being asked to resign? This is very serious. The Secretary to the Treasury calls and tells them to resign and threatens them, If not, there will be a Parliamentary procedure", like what happened to Shirani Bandaranayake. Persons who have done well in the industry, who have some standing in these industries give up much to come and serve on these regulatory Commissions. They do not want to be dragged through mud; they do not want to be victimized politically like this. So, they will resign and go.

But, what happens to the governance? What happens to all of these laws? Through ages, through decades this Parliament has established laws so that governance is better, that regulatory functions are done by independent persons. You may not like it - this is not something new, not something surprising, but the Executive generally does not like regulators - but that is desirable, that is the way it ought to be and that is the way this Parliament has willed that it should be. When you behave like this, you are doing it so blatantly, there is no hiding it even. The new State Minister of Prison Management and Prisoners' Rehabilitation, -

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 18 .

[3.33 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Presiding Member, I am pleased to participate in the Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Justice. As a first exercise, I reviewed the Progress Report from January to September of the Ministry of Justice. One of the goals mentioned in it is that a new Constitution is going to be created to fulfill the aspirations of the people and a panel of experts has been appointed for that process. We have no issue with the panel of experts that has been appointed; they are eminent people. But, I would like to point out that the Constitution-making process is a much wider process than just having a panel of experts.

If you look at the history of this country, right through, there have been several constitution-making processes and what is at the core or the centre of it should be peoples participation. I think the Constitution is not just a matter of legality; it is far more fundamental. Obviously, all people in this country are not satisfied with the Constitution that we have. Some feel ownership; some have a sense of alienation. There are basic issues like what the fundamental principles on which we agree as a united people. What does equality mean? And this is true particularly for the minorities in this country who are often asking that question. Is democracy and majoritarianism the same or if not, what are the checks and balances that a Constitution should have? Therefore, I think initially, we should have agreement on the principles of Constitution making and then get into the details of Constitution making. Also in this Progress Report, I see that there is reference to the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution. I will come to that in just a moment.

My attention was also drawn to the status of the judicial administrative system in this country. The average time taken to enforce a contract in Sri Lanka is 1,318 days. Why would investors come into this country? Sri Lanka has been ranked 161 out of 189 countries in the enforcement of contracts. Sri Lankas legal system is ranked fifth out of eight countries in the South Asian region. Land partition and testamentary cases, on average, take a generation to be settled. A criminal offence takes nine and a half years to conclude in the original court. A criminal matter, on average, will take a year to be fixed and for appeal and three to four years for the said appeal to be completed.

2945 2946

I see that the Minister has set himself the goal of increasing the number of judges per million people, maybe, from 15 to about 30 while some countries have more than 100. I also see that there are 22 Bills, Acts or Ordinances to be amended and brought before Parliament. Those are laudable.

My attention is also drawn, not just to goals, but also to the process of doing the things that we are doing. That is why I refer to the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution. In a democracy, the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary must be independent from one another. Therefore, we need to build trust in the Judiciary. I have mentioned this before and I mention it again. It was unwise to bring substantial Amendments to the Twentieth Amendment at the Committee Stage, increasing the number of Judges of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal. It was certainly an unwise process to do because then, the citizens of this country do not have an opportunity to question the lawmakers or laws that we enact in Parliament. In some countries, they have the opportunity of post-enactment judicial review. India has it, the USA has it, but Sri Lanka does not have it. Our citizens have only a small window for that at the Bill stage. They could go to court and question its constitutionality. But, when you bring in amendments at the Committee Stage, that opportunity is taken away from the citizens of this country. Justice must be done, but justice must be seen to be done as well. That is very important, that it is seen to be done. . , . But, what happened? I am not going to argue about the past.

I am looking at the present Government, the present Budget and am trying to focus my discussion on that. Much has been said about the past. Two wrongs do not make a right. I work on that premise. So, let us try to get it right. What I am trying to say is, certain names of judges had been mentioned in the media as those possibly going to the Supreme Court or to the Appeal Court of the country. These were in the media and after they had been approved by the Parliamentary Council on the nomination of the President, I think the proper process should have been for them to be given an immediate letter of appointment so that they could act in that office. I can see the logic of doing it, to hasten the process of justice. But, we need to go beyond that and the process is important. What we have done now is, we have embarrassed some of these judges by allowing them to continue in their existing positions and delivering judgments. That is the issue with this.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) Hon. Member, you are correct. We have already appointed all of them. All of them had sworn in about a week ago and they are awaiting their ceremonial sitting to start work.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Yes, Hon. Minister, I followed every step of that, but there was a gap between their being sworn in and their names arriving before the Parliamentary Council. There was a gap of time. I am talking about the process. I am saying that the esteem of the judges should be protected and not affected. The process is important; having it planned, is important.

We heard of even accusations today about the rentals that are going to be paid. I am not arguing that those do not have to be paid, but I am saying that the process is important. I do not know a single thing about these verdicts, whether these verdicts are right or wrong and neither have I read these judgments. So, I cannot comment on the judgments and I do not intend to comment on the judgments. But, whether you take the sil cloth case, the order given on Rishad Bathiudeen, former Minister, Gotabaya Rajapaksas summons being withdrawn in Lalith-Kugan case or any case - there were many other cases - the process followed is not good. We must always act to protect the integrity of the Judiciary even in that process. Justice must be done and justice must be seen to be done and that is why I have opposed from the beginning when amendments were brought to substantial Bills at the Committee Stage. Under the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution, an amendment was brought to the Judicial Service Commission, which has the Chief Justice and the two senior-most Judges in it, so that the President can appoint the two Judges as well. Therefore, the whole responsibility lies with the President now. That is the problem with the politicization of this. That is why we have argued against this. The basis of appointments was referred to today as seniority, but we saw that seniority was not always observed. Seniority and merit had been looked at in the past, but that was not observed. That is very unfortunate.

Madam Chair, I would also like to comment on another issue. The issue is that there were two cases taken up during this period. Parliament was dissolved. Some went to court and said that Parliament needs to be summoned within three months. The court heard the arguments for and against and after ten days, it was decided not to give leave to proceed. I think people have a right to reason. I am not arguing about the law, but that people have a right to reason.

The second case is, we had the civil society going to court and arguing that forced cremation - I am talking about forced cremation - is not fair. People must have the choice, to decide whether it should be a burial or a cremation. It is not just the Muslim community who, because of their religious persuasions, do not want the dead to be cremated, but in this case, even Catholics went to court. The civil society went to court and they made their arguments. After two days of hearing reasons for and against, the court decided that there was no leave to proceed. I continue to say that there should be reasons given. There should be right to reason. These people need to know why they are not allowed to bury their dead.

Releasing prisoners to prevent spread of COVID-19 in prisons . This was written on the 26th of March, 2020 by eminent organizations and persons and I will not read out all their names. They had written it because they saw the dangers ahead. They saw the danger in March; they wrote it in March and said this. Just to read a few extracts from the letter, it states, I quote:

We are also aware that more than 50 per cent of the prison population in Sri Lanka are remand prisoners and that a large number of the convicted prisoners are those who have defaulted on paying fines.

It further states, I quote:

On 16th March, 2020, the Committee for Protecting Rights of Prisoners appealed to the President, the subject Minister and the Commissioner-General of Prisons to consider releasing prisoners to de-congest prisons to prevent the spread of COVID-19,

I know that you were not the Minister at that time, but I am reading this letter just to bring to the attention of the House that this problem was brewing.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) Hon. Member, we have done everything they have suggested. We have repeatedly done that. We have released people on Presidential Pardon and also released people who could not pay their fines. We have also had so many discussions with the police and the relevant authorities. That is how the number of inmates, which was 33,000 at one point in time, was brought down to 26,000. I know we could have done better. But, we have done so many things that they had suggested even before I assumed office, not that we have ignored any of those things.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I am glad to hear that you have done something, but ultimately, a government, a minister or a ministry will be judged on the results and the results we had are really tragic. We witnessed more recently some of those in State custody losing their lives. We had a situation some months ago where a person allegedly involved in the drug trade losing his life after being extradited from another country. That is not a good thing. We also have had in this country extra judicial killings. Previously, in 1983, we had extra judicial killings in our prisons. We also had, in 2012, extra judicial killings in our prisons and then again in 2020, very unfortunately, while we are Members of Parliament, we had extra judicial killings in our prisons.

This is very unfortunate because the Government has a responsibility to protect them. When we take somebody into custody, they give up their liberty and they cannot protect themselves. So, the Government must protect them; the Government must provide for them. That is a basic human need and a human right. You have to do that.

I want to thank the Government, when the situation of SSP Shani Abeysekara was brought up, for ultimately transferring him to the IDH. We have seen in the press that SI Mendis has also contracted COVID-19. These are press reports and I have no independent confirmation.

One of those press report states, " " . . , . . .

Madam Chair, finally, I am making a request. Do not destroy the evidence; do not kill those in custody and do not deny the families of their right to do the final rites for the dead, the right to decide whether it should be burial or cremation. Let us build a better society. , .

[5.37 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Hon. Presiding Member, having been a long-standing member of the Judiciary of this country and as a Representative of the Tamils in this august Assembly, I am indeed happy to participate in this Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Justice.

Sir, justice is the one clear expectation of all denizens of this country today. It is justice which is intrinsically interwoven with the day-to-day lives of the Tamils and their future. They are expecting justice for the innocents who were haphazardly and brutally killed at the tail end of the war. They are expecting justice regarding those who were enforcedly made to disappear from their midst. The political prisoners have been for long seeking justice for themselves. Our Muslim brethren are seeking justice to bury their dead, even if one from their community is the Minister of Justice. Our Catholic brethren are seeking justice for those who were killed in the bomb blasts of 21st April, 2019.

Justice and peace, Sir, are complimentary. If we are to ensure peace, the first step would be to obtain justice for all those affected in body, mind, intellect and also temporally. Pope Paul VI said in 1972, "A peace that is not the result of true respect for man is not true peace. A sincere feeling for man is called justice. He further said, If you want peace, work for justice.

Is the present Government interested in working for peace and therefore, for justice? I doubt it. If you had the slightest feeling for your co-citizens, you would not expropriate the lands of indigent Tamils, as done even today, you would not destroy the archaeological sites and heritage symbols of the Tamils and you would not be gathering and accumulating such large numbers of the Sinhala military amidst the Tamil-speaking denizens of the North and the East. If this Government has feelings for the affected and the downtrodden, they would not try to grab from them, but instead give them help and solace. If this Government has feelings for their fellow human brethren, they would treat them with love and respect. But, you are interested in grabbing from us our land, our traditional way of life and our freedom. You continue to treat our people as the vanquished and not as co-humans in this Isle. None of us have been vanquished; we still carry the torch of freedom in our hearts!

( ) (The Hon. Lohan Rathwaththe) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Lohan Rathwaththe, what is the point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Lohan Rathwaththe) , . ? [Interruption]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) .

Speaking of justice, I would like to point out that in this country, we appear to be on the side of the wrongdoers rather than the innocents. Have we punished one single person who was involved in torture, murder, arson and rape committed during the 1956, 1958, 1961, 1977, 1981 and 1983 pogroms? Have we punished one single person involved in the burning of the Jaffna Public Library which housed 97,000 rare books and manuscripts? It was the best library in the Southeast Asia at that time. Have we punished one single person involved in the crimes against the Muslims in recent times? At least, has there been an attempt at accountability in that regard? Have we enforced the recommendations in several reports of Commissions submitted to the successive Governments? They have all been conveniently shelved.

Despite a Muslim Minister and a Tamil Minister in authority, let us not forget that power is in the hands of the majority community. It is they who decide what is best for us all even in areas where we are in the majority. Since Independence, that has been the case. We have no inclusive justice in Sri Lanka; we have only selective justice. Nowadays, it is justice selected for the well-being of the Sinhala Buddhists only.

We have a peculiar political culture growing up here now. Rewards and high governmental positions are today lavishly distributed only on the basis of how much suffering such individuals have brought to the minorities in this country. This culture is prevalent in this House too. That is why learned Parliamentarians are today vying with each other to provoke their minority Colleagues, to shut them up from speaking and bringing out facts about themselves and the Government. - [Interruption.]

There is systemic racism now being promoted in the country against the Muslims and the Tamils. Racism has become an ideology. It is now being sowed freely in the far corners of this blessed Isle. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Lanza) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

2991 2992

2020 09

, , " . " . . .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Government departments have been made the instruments to promote such ideology. Parliamentarians behaving indecently in this august Assembly are carriers of this ideology. Even the press is being made into an instrument to sow the seeds of racism. Such racism is not going to take us anywhere. On the contrary, this country is soon going to suffer by such propagation of negative and vituperative ideas and ideology.

I found a phrase on the website of the Ministry of Justice which states, Law reform to respond to the societal needs in keeping with global advancements and the aspirations of the people. That is their vision. Are we really following this vision? Everything happening in this Island of ours points to the opposite direction. While the world tries to travel on the path of enhancement of human rights, group rights of communities, reconciliation, peace and coexistence and laws are accordingly enacted in their Parliaments, what are we doing? The Government is trying to find out ways and means to take away the rights and assets of its citizens belonging to particular groups. It is trying to deprive the lands of these particular group citizens and trying to erase evidences of their culture, heritage and way of life. What else is the reason for the Presidential Commissions empowered to deal with the North and the East? Ad hoc Commissions are hurriedly appointed to take over the lands of our community under the pretext of protecting Sinhala Buddhist archaeological remains. Buddhist remains are no doubt there, but the ancient remains are from the time of the Tamil Buddhists - Demala Bauddhayos. The Tamils jettisoned Buddhism long before the Sinhala language was born. If you are trying to preserve the remains from the time of the Demala Bauddhayos, you must have majority Tamil commissioners in these Commissions. Are you trying to take over the lands of the Tamils and give them to the Sinhalese? Is that the purpose of these Commissions? Any steps being taken in the North and the East must be with the consent and concurrence of the Tamil-speaking majority community in the North and the East who have continuously occupied those areas for over 3,000 years.

, ( () - , )

(The Hon. (Prof.) Channa Jayasumana - State Minister of Production, Supply and Regulation of Pharmaceuticals) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

Sir, the Hon. Member is distorting the facts mentioned in the well-known history. There are no archaeological, historical or linguistic evidence to support any Tamil

homeland in the Northern or the Eastern Provinces in Sri Lanka. He is trying to use this Discussion to distort the well-established facts in the history.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Member, you continue.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Let us not forget that Tamil youth took up arms not against the Sinhalese and their sovereignty. They took up arms because there was danger to their sovereignty in their areas in the same country. They wanted to protect their identity. But, they were called "terrorists" and brutally dealt with getting help from no less than twenty other countries.

Let us remember, it is the sovereignty of the people which is paramount, not of the State. That is the international take on this at present. Let us not deceive ourselves that we could take shelter under State sovereignty and destroy the peoples sovereignty. The concept of State sovereignty which prevailed in the Eighteenth Century is no more accepted by the international community. When human rights of the people in a country are violated, it is possible to disregard the State sovereignty of that country. This is the modern concept.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) You have only one more minute, Hon. Member.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Sir, I would like to point out the contradiction in the arguments of many a Sinhalese politician. Many of you say that the LTTE used ordinary civilians as human shields and it was the Government forces which saved the people. Hence, you say no war crimes were perpetrated, but you did a humanitarian service. If so, it is the people who should say so now that the LTTE is no more. On the contrary, our people say you had brutally killed their kith and kin. If you had actually saved our people, our grateful people should have voted for you in all the elections after 2009. But, how come the people, whom you identify as those who were used as a human shield and whom you saved, have been voting for the TNA and whom you call even today as an LTTE proxy? How come in the very first Northern Provincial Council Election in 2013, our people gave me over 133,000 votes, a record amount for the Northern Province when I was absolutely new to politics?

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. Next, the Hon. Piyankara Jayaratne, please.

They are in prison for a crime they have not committed and that is wrong. As a nation, as responsible adults and parents, we should be ashamed of that. However, I was made to understand that the Hon. State Minister of Prison Management and Prisoners' Rehabilitation and the Hon. Minister of Justice have taken steps to move those children with their mothers to a different prison, for which I am very thankful. I brought up this issue and it has been addressed as soon as possible; it was addressed straightaway and I am again thankful to the Hon. Ministers for that.

The other matter I want to raise is about the kindergarten that is being conducted within the prison. . . , . . . 750 , . 35 . . . Their brain starts developing rapidly at this age. So, it is a huge damage we are doing to these innocent children who have never committed a crime.

Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to bring to the kind notice of the House that at present the plantation workers' daily wage is only Rs. 700 per day. As per the number of working days, they receive only about Rs. 14,000 to Rs. 15,000 per month. Even if their daily wage is increased to Rs. 1,000, they will receive only Rs. 20,000 per month. So, that is much less compared to the salary that many other workers around the country draw.

Hon. Presiding Member, the Budget proposes very few measures to overcome the most pressing issues faced by our young workforce in the country. The Government has already announced plans to recruit about 100,000 unskilled workers as well as 54,000 unemployed graduates. But, there is little fiscal space for such moves. A range of changes should take place in order to increase the productivity in an inclusive and progressive manner. According to the data compiled by the World Bank, Sri Lankas private sector has a large component of contract and informal workers. I think that reduces access to the social safety nets such as insurance, maternity leave and sick leave as well as EPF and ETF payments. So, clearly, the labour law needs to address this desperately to promote and protect the rights of the workers through reforms.

[7.48 p.m.]

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Chairman, I am glad to take part in the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Justice, especially with the Minister being present. I can see why His Excellency the President chose the Hon. Ali Sabry to be the Minister of Justice after seeing how he took up the rather difficult task of justifying the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution and the way he did it. In fact, after his speech I met him in the Lobby. I told him that he was almost convincing because that was how convincing or forceful his arguments were.

I wish to basically bring up three issues, Sir. The first one is with regard to the ICCPR Act. That is, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Act. As you know, Hon. Minister, when the ICCPR was adopted, the background behind the ICCPR was actually to maintain global peace. Soon after the World War II, there was a need by the UN to maintain global peace. Global peace meant that not only should there be steps taken by the UN to make sure that peace is maintained between States, but that within a State, there has to be regulations adopted and various norms met to ensure that peace is maintained within the country. So, it is on that basis, Hon. Minister, the ICCPR was adopted.

Sri Lanka ratified the ICCPR in 1980, but I think eventually it was only somewhere in 2007 that the ICCPR Act, which purported to bring into domestic law the ICCPR itself, was passed. There are serious shortcomings with regard to the ICCPR Act. If you look at the ICCPR and the Act, what you will see is that there is a massive gap. Although the ICCPR Act purports to make law the ICCPR itself, it falls far short. A good example is, in the ICCPR, Article 1 talks of peoples right to self-determination. But, that has been explicitly omitted in the Act. When the matter was taken up before the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court, very unfortunately, gave me quite an astounding answer, that the right to self-determination is a collective right and

3039 3040

[ ]

2020 09

what that right means is that all peoples have the right to self-determination.

In Sri Lanka, there are several peoples. You cannot deny that. So, you cannot simply say that the entire population of Sri Lanka is one, that there are no differences, that there are no several peoples, that there is no plurality and that the whole of the population must be taken together. But, unfortunately, that is what the Supreme Court said. It said, therefore, sovereignty vests in the people and since soverignty vests in the people, there is no need and in fact, there cannot be separate sovereignties and thus, there cannot be distinct self-determination to various segments of Sri Lanka's society. So, the whole purpose of the ICCPR was lost in the very first instance where Article 1 of the ICCPR was done away with. Therefore, what we have essentially is majoritarianism. We have majoritarianism. It is the will of 75 per cent of the population that effectively works through the ICCPR Act that we have today. But, it is not the only shortcoming.

If you go through the Act, what you will find is that several parts of the ICCPR laws - justiciable laws - have been completely omitted. If I may just quickly list them, the right to be recognized as a person before the law is recognized by the ICCPR Act; the entitlement of alleged offenders to legal assistance is recognized; interpreter and safeguard against self-incrimination is recognized; some aspects of the rights of the child are recognized and the right to access to State benefits is recognized. But, even though they are recognized, Hon. Minister, you will admit that they are not recognized in the context in which the actual Covenant spoke of these rights. Therefore, there is a massive gap even in matters that have been included. The rights that have been omitted are things like the right to life, the freedom from negative discrimination on the basis of national or social origin, freedom from the forced or compulsory labour, the security and liberty of persons deprived of liberty, the right to compensation for unlawful arrest and detention, the rights of minorities including in respect of religion, language and culture and the right to privacy. These are completely omitted.

So, the result, Sir, - I am sure the Hon. Minister will agree - is that what you have in the form of the ICCPR Act is, in fact, the complete opposite to the ICCPR itself. Why I am bringing this up is that the ICCPR Act is being used in the North and the East by the police to arrest people simply because they are asserting their own identity, and that is not fair. As you know, the ICCPR Act is a sophisticated form of the PTA. The moment you arrest someone under the Act, there is no bail. You have to go to the High Court and show exceptional circumstances for that. So, Hon. Minister, you must intervene because injustice is being done through an Act that is purported to, in fact, hold the rights, recognize the rights and protect the rights of minorities and the non-majorities.

The second matter that I want to raise is this. I am glad the Hon. Minister of Foreign is here. I think since the question of accountability has come under his Ministry, obviously the Government is not interested in internalizing accountability. So, they have given it to the

Foreign Ministry. I think the previous Government was also guilty of that offence.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Member, you have only two more minutes.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I will try and complete my speech within the time.

Today is the International Day of Commemoration and Dignity of the Victims of the Crime of Genocide and of the Prevention of this Crime. The Hon. Minister knows that. Whether you agree with it or not, the Tamil victims say that genocide had been committed. Sri Lankas position internationally, through the Foreign Ministry at the UN Human Rights Council, Sir, is that Sri Lanka is not prepared to have an international investigation and that it is entirely a domestic matter. But, is the crime of genocide recognized in Sri Lanka? Are the crimes in the Rome Statute recognized? They are not. So, even though the Hon. Minister of Foreign goes abroad and says,"We will investigate and we will hold everyone to account", it is a humbug, it is a joke. It is purely a Foreign Ministry-related exercise to somehow convince the international community that you are on board and that you will try and be responsible, but that is it. The previous Government was also guilty of that same approach where the Foreign Ministry was kept in charge of the question of accountability.

Finally, I wish to state this to the Hon. Ali Sabry. The previous Members from the SJB spoke in terms of the MTV media institution being unfairly taken before court and in fact, they accused you saying that there was Government involvement because one of your juniors was appearing in the case for George Steuart Health. Hon. Minister, the fact is, these are high-profile cases and we all know that George Steuart Health and Derana institutions are also connected. We all know how close the Derana institution is to this Government. So, you cannot run away from the fact that there is a strong perception that this is a deliberate act against the MTV, particularly on the issue of COVID-19 because they were exposing various matters. In that backdrop, Hon. Ali Sabry, when juniors of yourself appear for cases - I understand, but you are in an unenvious position because you hold such a high-profile position especially on justice - they must, unfortunately, make difficult choices because they must not embarrass you. This is my opinion. You can deny it, but there is a code of conduct where you must stand well above and even though you might deny it, obviously, you can, the proximity of this case, where the MTV and George Steuart Health are at each other in courts, gives the impression that very clearly the Government is behind it.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Member, you have taken two minutes extra.

3041 3042

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) So, I would urge you to think about these things becasue these are important when you talk in terms of the Ministry of Justice. We have had so many Members saying that justice must not only be done, but also must be seen to be done. Hon. Minister, you can answer in your own time.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) Sir, just give me one minute. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes, Hon. Ali Sabry? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) Hon. Ponnambalam, I did not expect that from you. I know others could raise it for different ulterior motives of getting some telecasting opportunities. I must say this. I have trained more than 100 juniors. Can I have control over their professional obligations? Can I decide for whom they should appear and for whom they should not?

So, I do not expect that from Mr. Kumar Ponnambalams son. You yourself being a barrister know that it is not done. Do not make everything a speculation. We are not here to do that. I have come here to do a job at personal loss.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, may I just say something? - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) No, that is enough. We have hardly any time. - [Interruption.] No, we have no time to waste, Hon. Member.

Hon. Minister, I am not expecting you to reply to this matter. We are quite aware that you are taking whatever steps possible to get this matter resolved. You are privy to so many things that are happening within the Government and you have, in fact, discussed with several other MPs as well to resolve this issue. Particularly, the cremation only policy of this Government is a matter regarding which we have continuously been bringing the Governments attention trying to resolve it. I saw the Hon. Prime Ministers Office, too, has released a statement, but we are absolutely losing faith now. Since this issue is not getting resolved, the community is now going ahead with the civic resistance programme of refusing to accept the dead bodies. That is a very traumatic situation for the entire community. But, trauma aside, this is going to have serious implications for the country internationally; it is going to have serious implications for generations to come. Therefore, I am pleading with the Government to revise this policy.

I can quote what the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana, who is a renowned virologist, said. He is not a normal virologist, but a specialist in the field of bacteriology and virology. He holds a PhD in Virology from the University of London and has served as Director of the Medical Research Institute. He headed the MRIs Virology Department and had been a Consultant Virologist at the Edinburgh City Hospital Regional Virus Laboratory and Deputy Director of the Victoria Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Melbourne. What does such an important personality say? I quote him from the "Daily Mirror" of 9th December, 2020.

We have experts in the field, but none of them has been called for discussions. On the other hand, this is a virus, but as far as I know, there were no virologists in the committees that were set up. When you are trained in a particular discipline you get to know all aspects of it and be able to adapt it to suit the problem. We should have made use of the trained personnel we have, but the idea that it should be done by people with connections is the kind of thinking we have.

What does he say? Your own Member of the Government and a most senior virologist is asking, Who are these so-called specialists you have in these Committees? People who are denying what is scientifically correct and what is scientifically accepted all over the world are living in cloud-cuckoo-land and are

prescribing solutions which are hurting the sentiments of one community in this country. For Gods sake, I am pleading with you to consider this, because this is a very serious matter. Out of sheer outrage, total contempt, the people are looking at the actions of the Government in this case.

Hon. Chairman, just give me one more minute and I will conclude. So, this will not be forgotten for generations and this is creating a serious impact in the minds of the young Muslims. They will get radicalized out of this terrible trauma they are suffering. For Gods sake, I am pleading with you, please revise this or at least, change these committees. Who are these scientists? How can they call themselves scientists? Who are the epidemiologists you have in these committees? There had been an epidemiologist called Dr. Paba Palihawadana. She says burial is possible. Another senior epidemiologist, Dr. Nihal Abeysinghe, who, the other day, talked with Chamuditha very clearly said, Burial as an option is not objectionable and that is accepted by the WHO and that is correct. With all these epidemiologists and virologists being outside the committees, some pseudoscientists who have been appointed by this Government are holding the entire Muslim community to ransom and are making them suffer. Therefore, in the name of this countrys unity and communal harmony, I am pleading, please, for Gods sake, do revise this!

In the meantime, I must say, some of our Members have been inveigle to vote with you on the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution. I hope they will not bring themselves to shame again by going on voting with the Government when the entire community is in such distrust and is outraged. It will be a disgraceful act if they continue to do so untill the matter is resolved. Therefore, I plead once again that this matter be resolved once and for all by replacing this committee, if they are refusing to comply with it because there are so many experts who are saying this openly. The experts in the Government side, including your own Member, the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana, are very clearly saying that, but they all have been sidelined. Therefore, I am pleading once again with the Government to revise this cremation only policy without any delay and bring at least some solace to the suffering Muslim community.

Thank you. [.. 8.33] ( ) (The Hon. Mujibur Rahuman) , , .
