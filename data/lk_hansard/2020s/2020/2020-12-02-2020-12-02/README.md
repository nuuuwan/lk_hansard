( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) While the Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Leader of the House and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition are here, I must say that I actually raised this Question at the beginning, in the first week, of the month of September last year. Unfortunately, the Question has appeared in the Order Paper only today. I would like to ask the Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Leader of the House and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition to please inform all the Members of Parliament not to hand over Questions unnecessarily because I was told by the Table Office the other day that some MPs give around 50 to 60 Questions per week.

Manthri.lk rankings they are doing these things. So, it is very unfortunate because this Question should have been answered in the month of September. Therefore, please see if there is something that could be done. Even I can hand over one hundred Questions, but when I do that what will happen is, those Questions will appear in the Order Paper only in June and that will be useless. So, what is the point? The opportunity is being abused.

Sir, now I would like to ask my first Supplementary Question.

. . . . .

. Firstly, you have asked about the debt rollover challenge. . about the revenue challenge; . . Fitch Ratings Moody's that there is a difference of opinion between the rating agencies and the Government of Sri Lanka..

Thirdly, he highlighted the difficulties of attracting FDIs. I think you know very well, Hon. Leader of the Opposition, that during your period, very few investments came in although there were threats of various investments like the Volkswagen factory, a refinery for US Dollars 3 billion and also the worlds tallest building which was going to be built by a restaurant owner in Wattala. There were occasions like that when they went on some adventure and I will explain all that.

Then, the strategies to deal with the debt-to-GDP ratio.

he wanted to know the underlying reasons for the downgrading; . . . .

1545 1546

. . .

Sir, let me give certain parameters with regard to the entire Question that was framed by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition.

It is surprising to note that the Fitch Ratings assessment has ignored several key Proposals presented in the Government's Budget, 2021 with regard to deficit financing in the period ahead. We have set out various ways in which the deficit is to be financed. But, obviously, they have ignored it and so has the Hon. Leader of Opposition.

As indicated in the Budget, 2021, the Government has adopted a novel approach in relation to foreign financing while enhancing the effectiveness of already secured financing channels aimed at reducing the share of foreign financing of the Budget Deficit over the medium term. Sir, if you break down the total debt in 2014 into foreign debt and local debt, foreign debt was 40 per cent and the local debt was 60 per cent. But by 2019, as a result of the various measures taken by the previous Government, that ratio had gone up to 50 per cent of foreign debt and 50 per cent of local debt. So, we inherited a hugely-skewed situation with regard to foreign debt. That was of their making, but we will have to deal with it.

Yet, Fitch Ratings builds up an argument based on the "existing financing model", thus adopting a backward-looking approach. We are looking forward and they are looking backward, Sir. In contrast, the forward-looking financing model of the Government, which is skewed heavily towards domestic financing, will capitalize on the benefits of increased domestic savings and the low interest rate regime already in place, given the subdued aggregate demand conditions and well anchored inflation expectations. We are now seeing a low interest rate regime. The local interest rates are much lower than those at the time when the Opposition was in power. So, now we need to take advantage of that and that is what we are doing, Sir.

It is also noteworthy that the low interest rate regime will improve the economic growth prospects in the period ahead alongside the incentives being offered for capital investment, thereby supporting the envisaged debt consolidation efforts significantly. As the relative share of outstanding foreign debt has already fallen to 44 per cent as per the latest available data, projecting a rise in foreign debt servicing obligations in the period ahead cannot be corroborated with facts. The Fitch Ratings could not corroborate it with facts; neither can the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. Based on such unfounded assumptions, the Fitch Ratings projects a Government debt-to-GDP ratio of 100 per cent at the end of 2020 - our rate is much lower than that - and 116 per cent at the end of 2024, which grossly overestimates the Budget Deficit at around

11.5 per cent of GDP in 2021 and 2022. Our estimates are completely different to that and we do not agree with those estimates they have projected, neither are we agreeing with the estimates presented by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. The rating action announced on that day is based on these ill-informed model projections without any evidence-based and objective analysis. Further, as the share of domestic Government debt rises in a low interest rate regime, some increase in overall public debt-to-GDP in the near term is not considered unusual. There would be some increase, but we have factored that in our Estimates and we would be working on those lines. Furthermore, with the strong pro-growth orientation policy of the Government as clearly articulated in Budget, 2021, a possible rise in local currency denominated Government debt in the near term can be effectively managed within the envisaged fiscal consolidation path in the medium-term, as government revenue increases, helped by the envisaged take-off of the economy. There would be an improvement in the growth prospects and that would enable us to have additional revenues. It is also unrealistic to assume that the Government will take a rigid expenditure path if ,by any chance, the expected improvement in revenue does not materialize. Naturally, as with any responsible government, if there is some risk of revenues not materializing, we can take other measures in order to deal with that situation, Sir.

Sri Lanka, similar to many of its peers in the emerging market group, experienced initial capital outflows, exchange rate depreciation, slowdown in activity and pressure on Government finances in response to the effects of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Sri Lanka recognized its priorities early and swiftly introduced a policy package to withstand and mitigate the potential adverse effects of slowing down economic activity while building buffers for countering possible external financing challenges. With the decisive conclusion of the Parliamentary Election in August, 2020, the Government is now moving along a recovery path towards growth and stability even in the midst of the transitory disruptions caused by the second wave of the pandemic.

The Sri Lankan economy is expected to have recovered strongly during the third quarter of 2020. You asked about the growth prospects for the second and third quarters. The second quarter is now being looked at in relation to the third quarter as well, that is what I was told by the Department of Census and Statistics, and the statistics of both will be released together shortly.

The earlier than expected return of merchandise exports to pre-COVID monthly averages of US Dollars 1 billion and the curtailment of non-essential imports have reduced the trade deficit notably for the sixth consecutive month in October 2020, saving US Dollars 3.3 billion in import expenditure so far during the year, Sir. Meanwhile, the larger than expected increase in workers remittances together with other service exports, including IT services and shipping, helped mitigate the impact of the pandemic. The improvements in trade balance and workers remittances have helped cushion the current

1547 1548

account deficit to a large extent in spite of the downturn in tourism, thereby reducing pressure on the exchange rate and the official reserves. I am sure the Hon. Leader of the Opposition may have been surprised that the rupee is still holding, that the interest rates are still holding. That is because of the judicious management of these twin factors which are essential to ensure that Sri Lankas macro-fundamentals remain in a stable state, Sir.

The Hon. Leader of the Opposition spoke about Foreign Direct Investments as well. Foreign Direct Investments, which slowed down in the first half of the year, appear promising in the period ahead, particularly with the expected inflows to the Colombo Port City project and the new manufacturing projects in industrial zones including Hambantota. Just a few days ago, we saw a massive US Dollars 300 million project being signed in Hambantota to build tyres and we have already been assured by the Port City developers that a US Dollar 1 billion infusion of new capital will come in to the Port City development in the next year. The first phase of the Port City Project is scheduled to begin in 2021, boosting economic activity and attracting sizable non-debt creating financial flows into the country; it is non-debt, not debt. That means, dollars will come and those dollars, to a great extent, will be available for us to settle the loans that had been taken by the former Government. Further, from the list of FDIs approved by the Board of Investment totalling to over US Dollars 5 billion, a considerable share is expected to materialize supported by the new business-friendly environment of the country, and several major investment projects are already in the process of implementation.

The Hon. Leader of the Opposition also spoke about the need to improve our Doing Business Index. Under my Ministry, we are setting up a special unit in order to see that the developments in the country also involve the processes to be improved so that doing business indicators would also improve. I am sure he must be very happy to hear that.

The other expected investments include import alternative industries as well as investments by the World Bank and other international development financial institutions. Nevertheless, the Government will adopt a policy of "guided" imports as the envisaged improvements in growth prospects would experience some rise in import demand on raw material and investment goods as the foreign exchange liquidity concerns are expected to wane in the period ahead. It is noteworthy, however, that the Government will remain committed to strengthening the dynamics of the economy based on the principle of self-reliance.

With regard to portfolio flows, foreign inflows to the government securities market are yet to resume, but no significant outflows were noted in recent months. Stock market indices have improved continuously and surpassed the pre-COVID levels with a record level of activities over the last three months. Actually, the activities during the post-COVID period under our Government have been three times the activities that had taken place under the former Government during the last five years.

The tourism sector has been supported by domestic tourism and is expected to flourish once global tourist flows resume after the pandemic subsides. Despite the COVID-19 driven slowdown in economic activities in the first half of 2020, the economy is expected to rebound strongly in 2021 and sustain its growth momentum over the medium term supported by the stimulus measures already in place and the effective implementation of the pro-growth policy proposals announced in the Budget for 2021. If you carefully read the Budget and the Budget Proposals that we have put forward, Hon. Leader of the Opposition, you would see that there are so many areas in which those stimulus measures have already been put into place in our plan in order to deal with this situation.

Given these developments, the exchange rate remains broadly stable and the Central Bank has been able to absorb foreign exchange of over US Dollars 500 million on a gross basis since May, 2020. That is an amazing development. I think in the whole of the five years that the former Government was in office, they could not absorb that amount of currency. But, we have been able to do that. So, naturally, I am sure, they must be impressed and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition will probably take back what he said in posing his Question today.

The gross official reserves were estimated at US Dollars 5.9 billion at the end of October, 2020 with an import cover of 4.2 months. I am not satisfied with that number, I can tell you, because at the time when I was the Governor and left my office at the end of 2014, we had US Dollars 8.2 billion in reserves and the plan was to bring it up to US Dollars 15 billion by the year 2019. But, however, we could only get US Dollars 7.6 billion. So, naturally, there was a huge shortfall, which we have to now build up. That is what we are doing, Sir.

With the observed rise in foreign debt servicing and public debt in the period ahead, the Government will focus more on curtailing Government expenditure by resorting to several self-imposed, austerity-like economic measures on the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic through announcing measures such as restricting imports of non-essential goods, encouraging the State-owned Enterprises to curtail non-essential expenditure including purchasing of motor vehicles, instructing the State entities to strictly manage expenditure on fuel and other utilities and non-priority procurement et cetera.

The Governments strategy in foreign debt management is to avoid total rolling over of these upcoming maturities, while its strategy in overall debt management is to repay the outstanding debt while not raising more loans over the existing level over the medium term. So, what we would do is, we will rollover whatever we can, but with regard to high interest rate loans, we would endeavour to amass from the other inflows we are having so that we can bring down the overall foreign debt component to more manageable levels, which they had neglected. .

The recently introduced measures to entice foreign investors to the government securities market and the real

1549 1550

economy through an attractive foreign exchange swap arrangement are likely to help enhance foreign currency inflows in addition to the support of friendly countries, such as the swap arrangements and the expected disbursement of the second tranche of the Foreign Currency Term Financing Facility proceeds from the China Development Bank in December, 2020. Accordingly, the gross official reserves are expected to improve to around US Dollars 6.5 billion by the end of 2020.

. Debt management is not a single item. Therefore, it is an integrated approach that we are putting in place, Hon. Leader of the Opposition, because each one of these macro-fundamentals are dependent on one another. That is why we need to manage all these together. If we consider only one at a time, we will not be able to make this entire situation to move towards a benign status.

. Hon. Leader of the Opposition, you asked how we are going to manage the revenue collection. We are automating certain functions, bringing in the transactions under one net so that we will be able to monitor those very well and then will be able to collect the revenues, as a result. . .

. 2921 . . We have a lot of inquires with regard to the new investments that are to flow in.

. Swap . We are in conversation with reserve banks from different parts of the world in order to find ways and means in which we can cooperate. .

Like food and clothing, shelter is a basic requirement that is very important for us to live. Prior to 1979, there was no National Housing Development Plan. It was brought in only after Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa took over this Ministry. 1979 . Because of the success of that housing development programme, the year 1987 was named " " - "International Year of Shelter". "Gam Udawa" was not just a programme to build a village. It encompassed the entire area with the district development

plan. . . I remember, Sir, as a small boy, going for one of the "Gam Udawa" programmes with my father, the late Hon. Gamini Dissanayake. Since I was very small, I cannot recall which one it was, but I was very impressed as a young boy. The programme was absolutely amazing. . . .

. . . The first one is, not using housing and urban development planning as a tool for countrys economic development. 1979 . I must bring to the attention of the Hon. Minister that in 1933, President Roosevelt of America made a new deal under which he enacted laws and also gave Executive orders to ensure that those laws which were passed became a success story from 1933 onwards. The slow progress of providing housing for displaced citizens is another problem in this country. With regard to building houses which could withstand earthquakes and natural disasters, . . Then, enough State patronage has not been given for housing. When you carry on a housing programme, it is absolutely essential that you provide the basic infrastructure requirements such as roads, toilets and water. . . ; ; . .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Sir, please give me a few minutes more.

Then, there is no proper mortgage system in this country. 9 11 . So, it is very difficult. If you look at developed countries, the housing loan interest is only about 2 per cent because the bank can always keep the property or the land as a security. . . So, title deeds are a big problem in this country. Therefore, please bring about a correct system

1617 1618

and enact laws to give deeds to lands. Use new technology such as GPS to survey all the lands and to have a proper plan.

[2.27 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed) Hon. Presiding Member, let me thank you for giving me this opportunity to express my views at the Committee Stage Discussion of the Budget, 2021 on the Votes of State Ministry of Urban Development, Coast Conservation, Waste Disposal and Community Cleanliness.

The President has chosen the Hon. (Dr.) Nalaka Godahewa, a politician and a multi-qualified business professional with a wide range of experience in managing both public sector and private sector organizations across a number of industries both in Sri Lanka and abroad, as the State Minister to lead the Ministry of Urban Development, Coast Conservation, Waste Disposal and Community Cleanliness.

Under his capable leadership, we expect significant development in respect of cities and townships in the District of Batticaloa, which I represent. It is most relevant to mention here that some of the urban and township development projects initiated or started by me during my tenure as the Chief Minister of the Eastern Province still remain incomplete after my term came to an end on 30th September, 2017. I wish to bring two such projects to the

1619 1620

[ ]

2929 92

attention of the State Minister. The construction of a new building for the public market in Eravur is one such project. The public market in Punnakudah, which was built in 1922, is the only trading facility available to the traders and consumers of the area. During my tenure as the Chief Minister of the Eastern Province, the people of the area brought to my notice that the market building was old, dilapidated and has now become a health hazard as well for its users. Their request to me was to construct a new building in the same premises. In response to the request of the people, I intervened and succeeded in allocating funds through the Ministry of City Planning and getting the work executed by the Provincial Council. The construction was started in 2016 and was supposed to complete in 2017. But, unfortunately, with the termination of the Provincial Council on 30th September, 2017, the construction work of the market building came to a halt. The cash flow dried up and the incomplete buildings have become an eyesore now.

More than 150 traders evacuated from the old building and relocated in a temporary building are now left in the lurch, losing their only source of income due to the delay in completing the building and handing it over to the Council.

Also in order to fulfil a long-felt need for a cultural hall and a library in Eravur, I proposed to the then Ministry of City Planning to undertake the financing of that project. With their approval and agreement to finance the project, construction work was started in 2016 during my tenure as the Chief Minister of the Eastern Province. It was expected to be completed in 2017. After my departure, funding from the Ministry of City Planning also stopped and the construction work came to a complete standstill. The worksite of the project has now become a public eyesore. In respect of the public market, for the completion of construction work, the estimated cost is Rs. 90 million in addition to the payment of bills in hand to the value of Rs. 23.8 million. The contractor, the State Engineering Corporation, has assured that once the bills in hand are settled, they will complete Stage I so that trading activities can be started. For the cultural hall and the public library, a further Rs. 70 million is required. Since the function of city planning has now come under you, Hon. State Minister, I kindly request you to pay your immediate attention to this issue and make arrangements to finance the two projects and complete them. While I assure my fullest cooperation to the Hon. State Minister for a successful new career in State management at higher level, again I kindly request you to take immediate measures to complete the two projects I mentioned earlier.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. Selvam Adaikkalanathan. You have 13 minutes.

[5.20 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) Hon. Presiding Member, firstly, I consider it an honour and a great privilege to be able to initiate the first steps of my public service through the State Ministry of Estate Housing and Community Infrastructure. It is my belief that the plantation community's dedication to the improvement of the Sri Lankan economy over the past two centuries is second to none. Although the entire country benefited from economic development, those benefits, unfortunately, have alway not been reciprocated to the community which lives in the plantation areas. I wholeheartedly appreciate the trust placed in me by His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister in

challenging me to transform the estate community into a prosperous community with a household income, access to healthcare, education, shelter and whose other basic requirements are addressed.

Similarly, Sir, in line with the Vision of the Ministry, we are tirelessly working with other Line Ministries, the Plantation Human Development Trust, the Savumyamoorthy Thondaman Memorial Foundation and the New Villages Development Authority for Plantation Region mainly to empower the lives of the estate workers and also the informal sector that is present within the estates.

At the same time, I would like to clarify one more thing. There was an accusation hurled at me regarding the New Villages Development Authority for Plantation Region saying that I have resorted to political victimization and shutting down that instrument when, in reality, I feel that it is a great instrument for the up-country. I have never once mentioned before that it is not a great instrument. However, I would like to go on record that when my father, the late Minister Arumugan Thondaman had taken over the Ministry, he went through the accounts and found that one of the greatest achievements of the New Villages Development Authority for Plantation Region is building an office for Rs. 3 million, which cannot be seen to the naked eye. I have not seen that NVDA office at all. Anyway, that is the past. But, however, we will use NVDA to further to improve the lives of the plantation workers.

Thank you. [.. 5.31]
