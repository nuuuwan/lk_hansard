THURAIRETNASINGAM took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please start your speech. [5.00 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak on this Adjournment Motion. This is a very sorry saga. But, I am very happy to contribute constructively to this Debate in order to ensure that the miscarriage of justice that seems to have happened with regard to many issues is rectified.

Sir, you could see that this is a situation where the fight is over, but the battle is not. This is a continuous battle that is on with the officials and I will explain why it goes on like this. The demonic Central Bank is at height of all these activities in this instance. Ninety eight per cent of the problems related to this issue are connected with the Central Bank. The Forensic Audit Report was a spin- off of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry set in motion to go into the Bond issuance of the Central Bank and a Forensic Audit Report was requested by that Presidential Commission, the Cabinet of Ministers and myself as a Minister then to ensure that there is an independent probe into the various political aspersions cast upon many people.

We were able to ensure, due to the sagacity of the Hon. Speaker, that the Forensic Audit Reports were tabled. For reasons unknown, the Forensic Audit Reports were not tabled in Parliament at the beginning and it is a mystery. The reason attributed and mentioned by the Central Bank was that that would inhibit certain actions that have got to be taken legally. But, once you go through the 10,800 pages that have now been tabled in Parliament, which acts as the custodian of the people's rights, you would see that it is nothing but suppression of the Central Bank officials; it is nobody else who had been tried to be suppressed. That is the irony. I thought it is my

bounden duty to come clean only of matters referred to in the Forensic Audit Reports. As a Member of Parliament, I can withstand any pressures that come from within, from the Opposition or from the Government, but the officials may not be having the same privilege. Therefore, I would not want to burden any of them. What is already mentioned in the Forensic Audit Reports, I will substantiate with documentation.

Sir, as I said very clearly, no names of politicians are mentioned in those Reports, even though there have been aspersions cast on some. But, the officials of the Central Bank and certain disgraced companies have been referred to. The names of those companies have been withheld and that was the reason why the Forensic Audit Reports were not tabled.

Then, one of the most important things was that there was a doubt whether the selection of the audit firms was done only at the whims and fancies of the Central Bank. Sir, with your permission, I would like to table* this document I have here with me.

It states, I quote: "As stated in the notice issued to the public on 14 January, 2019 on the progress of the procurement process to select audit firms, the FAs were conducted in five assignments as set out below on Terms of Reference that were finalized in consultation with the Auditor-General and the Attorney-General:"

So, there is a general assumption that the two world reputed audit companies, KPMG and BDO, were selected with the concurrence of the Auditor-General and the Attorney-General. Therefore, there is no escape on that basis. It is a collective responsibility; it gives validity to this.

With that, we can basically look at what the role of the Central Bank is. The two main objectives of the Central Bank are to maintain economic and price stability

and to maintain stability of the financial system. , . Ceylinco Golden Key Credit Card Company , F& G Group of companies , CIFL . Entrust Securities PLC, ETI Finance Limited, the Finance Company, , . . . The protective element is handled by the Central Bank. The regulatory role or the supervisory role into the activities of all those institutions is with the Central Bank. But, when such an institution falls down or comes down, it is the officials and the Minister in charge who are held responsible. Until such time, it is the officials who run those. That is the heinous crime and the specific reason why I draw your attention to and highlight where the problem is. We have won a battle, but we have not won the war. This is a continuous process. The subtlety of the financial transactions is not known to very many people; it is well above them. As a result, you are unable to determine the real forensic loss. But, now, to the best of their ability, an attempt has been made to find that out and I respect that. But, what goes on and the defences made now sometimes come out as hilarious excuses.

Hon. Presiding Member, I took some initiatives on the 25th of November, 2016 when I saw the heinous crimes committed by the Central Bank and the demonic powers that had been - ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I will take just three to four minutes and finish my speech. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) No. There is no time left to be given.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, being a former Minister of Finance, I need to clarify these and ensure from this side that those are rectified.

Sir, due to lack of time, I would like to table* a document as Annexe I to show that I, together with the Cabinet of Ministers, proposed certain measures to ensure that we correct the errors that had been committed and to curtail too much power vested in certain people.

Furthermore, there is another document in which names of some officials of the Central Bank are given. I would also like to table* that as Annexe II.

With regard to Mr. N.W.G.R.D. Nanayakkara, the document states, "We noted various offers have been issued which caused avoidable loss to the Central Government". Then, there are certain references to Mr. S.S. Ratnayake of the Public Debt Department and Mrs. C.M.D.N.K. Seneviratne. With regard to Dr. M.Z.M. Aazim, it states, "We noted various offers were issued which caused avoidable loss to the Central Government and during his tenure, there was deviation from the laws, policies and guidelines -" ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, just give me two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) No. . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, we will ensure that that time is deducted from our side.

Then, with regard to Mrs. U.L. Muthugala, it states, "We noted various offers were issued which caused avoidable loss to the Central Government". Then, there is a reference to Ms. W.N.S. Fernando in the Front Office and the document states that the losses made on Direct Placements are not known. Then, with regard to Mr. C.J.P. Siriwardana - these are people who are in high office now - it states, "We noted various offers issued

which caused avoidable loss..." Then, there is also reference to Mr. K.G.D.D. Dheerasinghe. This information was not given in the Commercial Bank information-related activity. These were Direct Placements that had been made. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I will take just a minute more.

There is also reference to Mrs. Premaratna in this document. Then it refers to Mr. Wijewardena, the Godfather of all Bonds that were issued. He is the one who opened the subject matter on the 08th of January, 2008 to ensure that private placements go on. But, that was not rectified thereafter. Then, there is Mr. Nandalal Weerasinghe. He is connected with the EPF loss. The loss caused by Wijewardena was of Rs. 4,000 million. So, it goes on like this and there is a huge inflation - ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . 11 .

The submissions done for non-appointment of PTL as a Primary Dealer were modified to

delete certain critical points. No remarks as to why the said critical points were deleted could be in the documents provided by the department for review, hence, the activity of deletion remains questionable. Hence, it can be concluded that the assessment done for granting clearance was not done in a proper manner.
